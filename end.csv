Critic Name,Review,Rating
Sandie Angulo Chen,This is the steamy romance you want your teens to see.,2
Mark Jackson,"Blake Lively is lovely in 'It Ends With Us,' but this domestic abuse film needed less 'Sweet Home Alabama' and more black eyes and bloody noses.",3.5
Derek Sante,"I enjoyed it and the audience reactions back me up, with some saying it's better than the book. Grade: B+ from me.",4
Aglaia Berlutti,The plot of 'It Ends With Us' does not forget that part of the success of the book it comes from is based on the emotions of its characters. [Full Review in Spanish],3.5
Michael Cook,"It's similar to a Lifetime movie. It's decent, but flawed",3.5
Susan Kamyab,"“It Ends with Us” is an unforgettable, compelling story that will move all audiences.",4.5
Aaron Neuwirth,"I’m all for getting behind a melodramatic story that is clearly appealing to audiences who are not always well-served by theatrical releases, but being glossy and soapy can only get a movie so far.",5
Gisela Savdie,"Although the narrative may seem predictable in some aspects, the film presents unique elements, such as the way the camera captures episodes of violence, reflecting people's tendency to ignore such signs. [Full review in Spanish]",
Jackie K. Cooper,Blake Lively provides a strong entertainment core for this affecting romance/drama.,3
Sarah Marrs,"It Ends With Us has lofty goals it ultimately cannot meet, and the end result is a bad film that is borderline insulting in its depiction of the very subject it seeks to explore.",
Lisa Trifone,"There are only brief moments of intensity, none of which are brave enough to do anything but hint at what's really going on.",2.5
Terry Staunton,"Lively does well as the conflicted star of the piece, assured at every point of her character's emotional journey.",3
Micheal Compton,"It Ends With Us is well-made, but ultimately over-stuffed. There is a good film buried somewhere inside this Lifetime movie facade, making it even more frustrating to have to sit through.",2.5
Renuka Vyavahare,"The gaze feels like it’s a bit too obsessed with Blake’s beauty than her ability to bring a character to life. If you don’t look for relatability, you won’t mind watching this one more for the glamour than the substance.",3
Linda Cook,It's a realistic look at domestic violence that answers the question: 'Why doesn't she just leave?',3.5
Natalia Trzenko,"On the other hand, the creative decision... to structure the adaptation with the same point of view of the novel is very successful: Lily lives and narrates everything that happens. [Full review in Spanish]",3
Pablo O. Scholz,"As often happens, the theme may be attractive rather than captivating, yet the form is not. And that's what happens with this film, which is also very long.",2.5
Rob Gonsalves,"The movie isn’t disgraceful, but we may have a hard time distinguishing it from the usual Hallmark or Lifetime fodder aside from the star power of Lively and the bestselling imprimatur of Hoover.",3
Rick Bentley,"Too much caution keeps ""It Ends with Us"" from living up to its full potential.",3
tt stern-enzi,"A really interesting, multi-layered drama.",4
Leigh Paatsch,"Both its heart and head remain in the right place throughout. Worth a look, particularly if the book means something to you.",3
Diego Batlle,".... It ends up being a rather obvious, clumsy, and banal experience. [Full review in Spanish]",2.5
Laia Cabuli,While an adequate film with a good heart... its strange treatment of the most important themes and its fidelity to the original material makes the film feel somewhat superficial and fails to fully convince the average viewer. [Full review in Spanish],3
Robert Denerstein,"The same time, the movie's seductive slickness allows its seriousness to slide away too easily. So, I'll vacillate, as I think the movie does: It Ends with Us could have been better, but it also could have been a whole lot worse...",
Erik Childress,"Despite a very good performance by Blake Lively, the film is way too clean for its own good. Less in the depiction of domestic violence but in the smooth transition in which our heroine is able to leave it behind.",2.5
Barbara Goslawski,Trauma is not a plot device to dangle around in order to amp up the drama.,2
Dennis Schwartz,A glossy romantic sudser that's well-meaning but too breezy to be convincing.,4
Kayleigh Donaldson,"The roots of an honest story are here but misguided decisions smother them at every turn. A book this popular was never going to be allowed the benefits of a free-wheeling adaptation, regardless of how much it would have improved the narrative.",
Johanna Schneller,"Incredibly, Lively makes it all work. Beyond nailing Lily’s exact shade of auburn hair... she also conveys her luminousness and strength, and reminds you how pleasurable it can be to watch a romantic thriller.",
Rene Sanchez,"Blake Lively gives a moving performance in this inspiring story about the traumas we carry, and the power that each individual possesses to take control of their lives. [Full Review in Spanish]",3
Sara Michelle Fetters,It’s not often a motion picture makes me physically ill.,1
Rachel Wagner,It Ends with Us  is not for me. If it’s for you more power to you. I hope you enjoy it.,
Wendy Ide,"For a film that dips its Manolo-clad toe into the murky waters of domestic abuse, it’s unexpectedly aspirational, almost frothy in tone.",3
Brian Viner,"Anyway, it doesn’t really matter that It Ends With Us is cheesier than a wheel of Camembert and shallower than a toddler’s paddling pool because, you see, there’s a twist on its way.",3
Hannah Giorgis,"To young people who have become inured to the misery of modern life, there’s a seductive premise in these novels: Relentless suffering can give way to freedom if women want it badly enough. On-screen, performed by real people, it’s not as convincing.",
Brianna Zigler,"Naturally this all feels dishonest, cloying, and clumsy, as Baldoni’s directorial prowess can’t match that of a halfway decent HBO series.",2.5
Max Weiss,I appreciate the fact that this is ultimately a film—and book—about ending the cycle of violence.,
Kristen Maldonado,"Justin Baldoni directs a strong adaptation of the source material, being sensitive to the touchy subject matter and including full circle layers that add more meaning to moments in the film.",
Elsa Fernández-Santos,"In this sense, the film leaves nothing to the viewer's imagination, it fulfills its didactic and moralistic purpose, the issues become clear, and the famous circle breaks, even if it is surrounded by flowers. [Full review in Spanish]",
Michael Medved,"Blake Lively is convincing and impressive in this complex role, but even better is her co-star Justin Baldoni, who does a multi-dimensional job bringing to creepy and disturbing life a character who's simultaneously seductive and dangerous.",3
Candice McMillan,"There is an incontrovertible charm to this film, and, I hate to say it, this dissenter has cleanly cut out her piece of humble pie.",
Ayelet Dekel,"The film’s emotional trajectory is gripping, and Blake Lively delivers a luminous performance as Lily.",
John Nugent,"This is not a perfect film, but it handles the important stuff — abuse, trauma and recovery — unexpectedly well.",3
Manohla Dargis,"“It Ends With Us” is fitfully diverting, at times touching, often ridiculous and, at 2 hours and 10 minutes, almost offensively long.",
James Croot,"While some of the plotting is obvious and dialogue a touch too portentous, as a director, Baldoni brings the same raw edge of hand-held camerawork and naturalistic lighting that marked out his Five Feet Apart as a cut-above the usual teen weepie.",3.5
Sarah Vincent,"If you are a fan of Hoover’s novels, then this film is a must see. For moviegoers not in the know, it will be a horror show.",2.5
Emily Wheeler,"It Ends with Us offers both fun and a point, and while the blend isn’t smooth, it’s admirably ambitious.",
Brandon Lewis,"The film concludes by asserting that domestic violence is far more complicated than Hollywood has historically given it credit for being, and anyone can be a perpetrator or survivor. It’s a powerful statement that it doesn’t quite earn the right to make.",3
Jack Martin,"It is far from perfect, but It Ends with Us does offer enough solid substance to honour the heaviness of its source material in a film that, for all its flaws, takes the viewer on an effective emotional ride.",3
Keith Garlington,"Lively is the movie’s lifeblood. She gives a heartfelt performance that conveys both confidence and vulnerability while remaining authentic, even on the occasions when the material turns syrupy.",3
Roger Moore,Don't overthink it.,2.5
Troy Ribeiro,"The narrative is a carefully constructed emotional rollercoaster, designed to pull us into the orbit of its characters before shattering our hearts just as theirs break.",3
Steph Cozza,"Despite its over 2-hour runtime, It Ends With Us rushes through the plot, barely allowing enough time to process or feel Lily's trauma.",2.5
Caroline Siede,"As a cultural statement, It Ends With Us doesn’t quite get there. As a personal exploration of what it feels like to be caught up in a cycle of violence, however, it’s a much more powerful big-screen experience.",
Hope Madden,But nearly every issue the film addresses – such as the circumstances that make it difficult for women to leave abusive relationships – are raised and lowered with an efficient tidiness that betrays the story’s beginnings.,3
Richard Lawson,"A tearjerker that indulges in its red-meat drama, but then gives it the grace of shading and complexity -- and rare humanity.",
Katie Walsh,A bungled adaptation that is at once too close to its source and too far from it.,2
Andrea Chase,"After a surfeit of montages and Ms Blake contemplating Lily's journey through a veil of melancholy, it ends as predictably as it unfolded. Dull and stale though it may be, it does have the welcome virtue of being instantly forgettable.",2
Tom Gliatto,"[Lively] has a willowy vulnerability, an intriguing air of remote sadness and a soft, muffled voice that sounds as if she were speaking from within a pile of autumn leaves.",
Harry Guerin,"Although the biggest moments are present and well-acted, they play like 'next, next, next' instead of an engrossing final act.",2.5
Audrey Fox,"Between the flat acting, cheesy storytelling, and overall weird vibes, It Ends with Us is a cinematic failure on almost every front.",1.5
Tim Appelo,"The frothy romance comedy lands better than the dark parts about men’s scary tempers, but on the whole, it’s one of the year’s more satisfying films.",4
Stephanie Zacharek,"Flowers, their short-lived beauty notwithstanding, can often brighten even the bleakest day. In this movie, they're treated like something we don't deserve, a blessing closed up tight, instead of a thing worth living for.",
Richard Roeper,"Lively is tasked with carrying the full weight of the story in “It Ends With Us” and she’s up to the challenge, but this is an uneven and turtle-paced romantic drama that feels like a missed opportunity.",2.5
Nelson Acosta,"The controversial bestseller written by Colleen Hoover makes for good trashy material, but the underlines in the message, direction, and performance leave the movie in limbo territory.",2.5
Matt Rodriguez,"There are a few shining moments where the performances come alive, but the majority of the film feels like a cookie-cutter addition to the genre that is more focused on making checkmarks on a list than delivering something a little more nuanced.",2
Todd Jorgenson,... downplays moral complexity and meaningful character dynamics in favor or treating weighty issues with a soap-opera gloss.,
Jonathan W. Hickman,"The film’s flat, conventional structure lessens the impact of its vital message.",2.5
M.N. Miller,It Ends with Us is a film about domestic abuse that may be seen as overly idealistic. It is nonetheless meaningful in portraying the power of healing and moving forward because of the main character’s dormant and suddenly active power of resilience.,3.5
Alistair Harkness,"The film teases out a darker story involving domestic abuse, but as a director, Baldoni manages to deal with it sensitively while embracing the melodrama of it all.",3
Mick LaSalle,"Is this a soap opera? For a while, that seems to be the case. But be patient because It Ends With Us is something more substantial. Plus, until it gets there, it’s a good soap opera, and that counts for something.",3
Richard Brody,"The commitment to the story and characters is unmistakable, and Baldoni elicits performances of tautly focussed, high-relief earnestness...but what remains is a mechanism of thrilling power that's missing a touch of mere humanity.",
Frank Wilkins,"Bravely tackles difficult themes with sensitivity and depth, leaving audiences with a lasting impression of hope and the courage to rewrite one's own story.",3
Devesh Sharma,"Despite the film's reliance on familiar tropes and occasionally simplistic dialogue, Lively’s instinctive and heartfelt portrayal ensures that its themes of self-acceptance and love are delivered with genuine grace.",3
Sarah Ksiazek,"I went into it not expecting to be impressed by any means, but the film has the potential to resonate with its intended audience, and I have to admit that it touched my heart at moments.",3.5
Adam Graham,"The movie's heavy themes make it a bit weightier than a summer breeze, but ""It Ends With Us"" is the big screen equivalent of a beach read: It's light on the eyes, easy to digest and simple to walk away from once it's over.",3.5
Erick Estrada,While at times too bubble-wrapped to spare our comfort... the theme is well-broached. [Full review in Spanish],
Daniel Pemberton,"A baffling, overlong and tonally inconsistent exercise in tedium.",
Dulcie Pearce,"Ryle being written as a good guy gone bad feels dated, making this Hallmark version of domestic violence ill-equipped to deal with the weight of the subject.",2
Charlotte Simmons,"Anchored by a mighty Blake Lively, 'It Ends with Us' brings Colleen Hoover's story to smartly cinematic and tremendously touching life.",4
Manuel São Bento,"It Ends With Us tries to balance heavy drama and conventional romance with some difficulties, but it manages to offer a minimally thought-provoking reflection on generational trauma and relationship abuse.",3.5
Peter Travers,Fighting their way out of the flowery tearjerking in the film version of Colleen Hoover’s mega-bestseller are a movie and a stellar Blake Lively performance that both take measure of domestic violence and the women who get to decide when enough is enough.,
Dana Barbuto,"Once we enter the more intense second half, the film struggles to hold up its end. It never feels quite sad or suspenseful enough to meet the demands of its heavy subject matter.",3
Andrew Parker,"Although there are some good intentions to be found within the confused melodrama It Ends with Us, they’re lost in a sea of odd choices and mixed messaging.",2.5
Allison Rose,"Despite its flaws, It Ends With Us is a must-watch. Its portrayal of abuse, though less violent, evokes strong reactions from audiences.",3.5
Richard Crouse,"Abuse is a thorny, ugly subject, and nobody wants to see explicit representations of it on screen, but It Ends with Us, while well-meaning, simplifies the issue to the point of melodrama. Sincere melodrama, but melodrama none the less.",2
Maria Lattila,"It Ends With Us has a lot more substance than you’d think, even if it often lacks ambition.",3
Jim Schembri,That the film largely avoids any bombastic moralizing makes its message all the stronger and all the more moving.,3.5
Brittany Patrice Witherspoon,It Ends With Us is a mixed bag of great acting and good direction begging to escape its hazy narrative.,2.5
Linda and Al Lerner,"This film had a lot going for it, but becomes a tearjerker melodrama misfire. Starring the gorgeous Blake Lively, two attractive sexy men, up-scale settings and revealing high-end fashions, there’s inauthenticity about the characters and the main theme.",
Mark Dujsik,[T]he whole thing comes across as a cheesy romance that makes a misguided effort to do something far more serious by the end.,1.5
Sophie Terakes,"Though replete with ridiculous character names and incredibly cheesy dialogue, the film manages to successfully blend its rather unserious, flowery façade with its heavy subject matter.",4
Russ Simmons,"Lively is appealing and Justin Baldoni, who also plays one of Lively’s romantic partners, does passable work, but this well-meaning film version is a bit too contrived for full emotional impact.",3
Chris Knight,"The themes are powerful, and the acting — particularly Blake Lively in the staring role — is for the most part excellent.",4
Charles Koplinski,"Unfortunately, the slipshod screenplay, which relies on ridiculous circumstances to move the story along, lays a shaky narrative foundation that fails to treat the characters' problems with the weight they deserve.",2
Sean P. Means,Even when the story beats are at their most predictable — several shots are devoted to Lively’s Lily looking in a mirror and applying concealer to an injury to her face — Lively brings her enormous empathy to them.,2.5
Nell Minow,"As close as a filmed version of a novel can be to a book, scene by scene, line by line. The fans of the novel who were in the audience at the screening I saw thought this was just fine, and they sighed happily along.",4
Alex Bentley,"The serious message of It Ends With Us may not be fully served by its relatively muted storytelling, but Baldoni and Hall justify their approach in a series of small ways that add up a satisfying whole.",
Dan Scully,"For all its eyeroll-worthiness, it proves to be one of the more sensitive and progressive explorations of abuse I’ve seen on screen.",
Robert Kojder,"It Ends with Us does conclude with an emotional, believable exchange that needs to be heard by domestic abusers around the world. It’s a shame the rest of the film is outlandish and doesn’t cut nearly as deep",2
ymrhqtrz,"I normally don't take to reading IMDb reviews and when I do I rarely agree with them, with that being said I wholeheartedly agree with every review that is giving the film the same score as I am if not a tad bit lower. Having grown up in an abusive household, the film did hit pretty close to home. Ryle Kincaid (Jason Baldoni) gave a stellar performance which genuinely encapsulates how unpredictable an abuser can be and how manipulative an abuser can be in a dv (domestic violence) relationship. With that being said that's where the entire score for my review comes from; baldoni's performance and direction.Blake Lively (Lily Bloom) went ahead and gave us basically nothing. There were moments during her performance I thought she had something, and then she lost it as simple as that. It felt like we as the audience were there more so for her outfits and hair than we were for her performance. Reading up on articles that state people have noticed two different films mixed into one, I couldn't help but agree with that. Baldoni's direction was centered around portraying an accurate picture of dv, and actually showing us the viewers this depiction, whereas Blake's version of the movie (as per sources) comes in through her one dimensional performance, weird placement of music in scenes that didn't require the music and if they did the music was just off and again showing us her outfits and luscious hair.I sincerely hope that if there is a baldoni cut of this film that it gets the light of day as the film I watched just didn't quite do it for me.",3
yasmeenmihyar,"In a few words: great message, stunning visuals, and impressive videography. However, the plot feels one-dimensional, as does the character of Lily, who lacks the depth needed to make her truly relatable or memorable. Sure, we're shown her trauma and backstory, but it doesn't fully draw you in or create a genuine emotional connection. It feels like there's a disconnect, as if her struggles are presented more as a narrative requirement than as a lived experience, making it hard to truly immerse yourself in her journey.The narrative structure also falls flat at times, creating a sense of frustration as it hints at greater potential that it never fully explores.",3
ekdecarvalho,"Another actress should have been casted as Lily. A costume director was required to style Lily. Ryle was great. Lily's mother needed more space in the movie, as well as the story between young Lily and Atlas. Should have inserted more content from the book and presented the characters as the book. Lastly, should have been marketed properly. The story is about domestic violence, and viewers should have been informed as such. Some viewers were surprised during the movie and not in a good way. I want to see the director's version of the movie, since we were shown the producer's version. I hope they release it.",3
kristyp81,"They went soft on the DV ...too arty, and did not succeed in evoking the tension and stress like the book did. I read that book with my breath held in those scenes... the movie failed here.Axel's character development was dissapointing... his backstory and abuse not revealed.I understand leaving out the Ellen journals... she not too popular these days ... :)The two leads were not matched well... though the sister I enjoyed!.Run time was also too long! I wanted more intensity, fear and confrontation, and for it to begin much sooner.This was not the Lily I imagined, but Lively played the ditzy, rom-com , sex kitten lead well.",3
jaysonpajaronvistal,"""It Ends With Us,"" the first Colleen Hoover novel to be adapted for the big screen, tells the poignant and deeply emotional story of Lily Bloom. A woman who has managed to overcome a traumatic childhood and is now chasing her dreams in Boston, including opening her own business. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she meets Ryle Kincaid, a charming neurosurgeon. Their intense connection quickly blossoms into a passionate relationship. However, as Lily delves deeper into her relationship with Ryle, she begins to see troubling similarities to her parents' tumultuous relationship. The plot thickens when Lily's first love, Atlas Corrigan, reenters her life, forcing her to make challenging decisions about her future and her own strength.As a film reviewer who has not read the source material due to a personal vendetta against the author, I took it upon myself to evaluate the film on its own merits. So, if you're expecting a comparison to the book, you won't find that here. This review is purely based on the film itself and my personal impressions. Any remarks saying ""the book is better"" won't resonate with me.The film has three standout aspects: Blake Lively's performance, the soundtrack, and the cinematography. Firstly, Blake Lively's portrayal of Lily Bloom is commendable. She brings a sense of authenticity and depth to the character that is both endearing and convincing. Lively manages to capture the nuances of a woman who has endured trauma and abuse without resorting to melodrama. Her subtle expressions and mannerisms effectively convey Lily's complex emotional landscape, making her performance the film's strongest suit. Without resorting to melodrama, Lively's portrayal feels both raw and genuine, which is crucial for a character with such a disturbing background.Secondly, the soundtrack is a significant highlight. Featuring songs by Lana Del Rey and Ethel Cain, the music adds a layer of emotional depth to the narrative. The soundtrack is so compelling that it occasionally overshadows the dialogue, but this is a forgivable flaw. In many instances, the music is more engaging than the actual conversations between characters, it kinda sucks but it enhances the overall experience for audiences like me who enjoy pop music.Lastly, Justin Baldoni's direction and use of handheld camerawork add a raw, realistic edge to the film. The naturalistic lighting and intimate camera angles make the film feel more grounded and relatable, which is crucial for a story that deals with heavy themes like trauma and abuse.Despite these strengths, the film has several notable weaknesses that detract from its overall impact. The narrative devices used in the film are glaringly obvious, and the dialogues often come across as pretentious. This pretentiousness, at times, borders on the ridiculous, making it difficult to take the characters seriously. While the film aims to address important issues such as trauma and generational curses, the execution is far from seamless. The blend of these themes feels forced, and the film struggles to do justice to the weighty subject matter of the source material.One of the most evident issues is the film's runtime. At two hours, the film feels unnecessarily long and repetitive. The pacing is inconsistent, with a drawn-out opening sequence that takes up the first ten minutes, followed by a rushed progression through key points in Lily and Ryle's relationship. This hurried pace leaves little room for character development, making it hard for the audience to fully grasp Lily's trauma or the depth of her connection with Ryle. The lack of chemistry between the two leads further undermines the film's romantic subplot. The characterization is another weak point. The film barely allows the audience to process Lily's traumatic past before plunging her into a whirlwind romance with Ryle. This rushed approach makes their ""deep"" love for each other seem superficial and unconvincing. The reintroduction of Atlas Corrigan into Lily's life, while intended to create conflict, feels more like a plot device than a meaningful part of the story. After all, the film does revolve around the story of Lily, so it's understandable that all characters, aside from Lily, are just background characters with little to no impact on the film. The film could have benefited from being 30 minutes shorter. With its 2-hour runtime, it felt overly long and repetitive, often going in circles without adding much to the story.In conclusion, ""It Ends With Us"" is a film that falls short of its potential. While it has its redeeming qualities-primarily Blake Lively's performance, the soundtrack, and cinematography-it is ultimately a forgettable and predictable story. The film's length and pacing issues, combined with its pretentious dialogues and lack of character development, make it a shallow and, at times, boring experience. For those who have not read the book and are looking for a film that tackles heavy themes with emotional depth, ""It Ends With Us"" may still offer some emotional resonance. It has the potential to pull at the heartstrings and take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster. However, for viewers seeking substance and a more nuanced portrayal of trauma and relationships, the film is likely to disappoint.""It Ends With Us"" can be seen as part of the ""once beloved book turned into a film disaster"" club. It serves as a reminder that not all popular novels translate well to the big screen. While the film does honor the heaviness and relevance of the theme to some extent, it ultimately lacks the depth and coherence needed to make it a truly memorable cinematic experience.",0
junaide-35640,"Been waiting for the movie ever since the trailer came out. Also Have been reading a lot on the internet, how people, specifically the book readers, not liking the cast selection as they are older than what you could perceive from the book.After watching the movie i feel completely opposite. I think the cast was selected perfectly from movie point of view. Blake has done an amazing job and so did the others. The characters were imperfectly perfect. The songs in the movie made the moments more enjoyable. Overall it was amazing, a complete emotional ride. I thoroughly enjoyed it (there wasn't a single dull moment).Totally recommended.",4.5
alexisruttley,"This film was good but my god it could have been so much better, the messy hair weird clothes & style is a total miss for me the casting of Lilly in no way portrayed the book and really let down what could have been a an amazing movie such a shame. Justine plays a fantastic part with passion and young Lilly is absolutely outstanding she is everything I wanted her to be.Since the movie the press tour has really missed the message that should have been driven from this book this is a topic that has touched the lives of so many women and the light hearted buy this nail polish wear your florals is very disrespectful and at times hurtful to survivors & victims it's 2024 come on do better.",3
sirgarrykay,(No spoilers) I've of course heard of the book but had no idea what it was about and didn't even watch the trailer to be honest. I just know it's a good book from friends and I like Blake Lively and I had time to kill today. Wow. What a good movie. Like really good. It's shot very well. The cinematography reads like a book and it just flows so well. The acting is really good too. It wasn't cheesy or trying to be a book to movie adaptation. You ride the waves of emotions and root for these characters too. It makes me want to read the book now which I'll probably do! I went to a matinee showing and it was pretty full. I overheard someone say they enjoyed the second half better but I thought the beginning was strong too lol. Definitely watch! You find out why it's called It Ends With Us and it's a beautiful yet heartbreaking story.,4.5
sammiejane-84520,"Hello reader,
I read the book first, just a few weeks before seeing the film. Hands down, this is one of the best, if not the best, book-to-movie adaptation I have ever seen.Wonderful acting, lovely soundtrack, and it just slammed you in the face with emotion. As someone who loved the book, imo, it hit all the right notes and important scenes. Ignoring the book, this was just a great movie in it of itself; a touching film with an important story.While there were a few scenes that I wish had been included, the story flowed well and, unless you read the book, it tied together wonderfully and you didn't feel like you were missing anything.I watched this movie with my mom, who also read the book several years ago. It was a great way to spend the evening with her, and I loved hearing the other audience members going through the feels with us. All in all, great movie, great book.Now, I hope whoever read this has a great day/night and finds a lucky penny somewhere.",4.5
ryanpersaud-59415,"I was one of four dudes in the theatre watching this, having been taken by my wife. Honestly, I totally get the appeal of this movie. It tells a very compelling story with a meaningful message. It's actually a movie that had me wanting more, which is also part of the problem. For the positives, I think when this movie acts as a standard(ish) romantic drama, it works pretty well. As I mentioned before, I think it captures aspects of a very difficult subject really well; namely, confusion. It's hard not to be at least somewhat emotionally affected by this movie; it succeeds in doing this, at least in the moment. (Think of Saltburn)But..the movie falls flat on a couple of levels. I think one is tone. It bounces around between Lifestyle channel rom com to serious drama like a ping pong ball, and while that can work, I don't think it does here. Especially when these characters - Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj's - feels like parodies of comic relief in these movies.The film also spends way too much time on the romance, and not the relationships that would actually matter. We get frustratingly little of Lily's relationship with her Mom and Dad, and too much about a guy she liked back when she was 18. (Blake Lively). Isabella Ferrer looks EXACTLY like a young Lively and was really underutilized here. The sort of ""love triangle"" angle just fell flat for me as it genuinely felt as if the ""other man"" Atlas (terrible name), just sort of existed in the confines of Lily's attention. When she thinks about it or the plot needs him, he's there. Anytime else, he might as well not exist. It feels like his life was put on hold (and yet, he managed to open up a successful restaurant) ever since she left their small town.Speaking of Lively...man. Her acting range is so limited; this movie really could've used a more expressive and talented actress in this role to really drive the emotions home, and it's a bit of a shame they didn't. (There is some controversy regarding her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds' meddling with this film, but it doesn't really impact the story - let's just say, Deadpool & Wolverine had more to do with this film's marketing strategy than you'd think). Another thing I noticed, but normally would comment on, were the costumes. I actually whispered to my wife during the movie that ""Lily really loves crop tops, eh?"" because it's weird how many times we see this specific outfit in the movie. (Call it sexist, but a lot of women have commented on the costuming as well online, so it's not just me).I also feel like the way this movie is filmed makes it feel extremely small, despite the constant references to Boston. Movies that reference a place a lot should give you a SENSE of this place, but honestly, the world of this movie feels like it comprises of ten people. We get a couple of establishing shots here and there, but there's really no life to this world. Hell, not a single character interaction UNRELATED to the main plot that I can think of.Look, this movie seemed to be received well by my audience and myself. But I also heard a lot of people talk about what it's missing from Colleen Hoover's book, a lot of which sounded relevant. And, I can't help but say it feels like the case.",2.5
SokaPokaDoka,"It's a slow-paced romantic drama. The story was fine but not much happend. As the movie went by; I was kind of thinking «where is this going?» I found a lot of the plot to be driven forward by coincidences which I dont think is a quality sign.On the plus side, I didnt find the movie boring. It was emotionally engaging, sometimes more succesfull than other times. A lot of the characters were likeable with clear flaws and strengths. The movie was visually pleasing.I think the movie was well made but the phasing and the story will not be everyone's cup of tea. It relies heavily the characters and less on the bigger picture.",3
harishnj,"Colleen Hoover's beloved novel comes to life in a film that captures the raw emotion and complexity of its story. Lily's journey of love, loss, and self-discovery is a rollercoaster that will leave you both breathless and inspired.The performances are outstanding, drawing you into the characters' lives and making their struggles feel achingly real. The film doesn't shy away from difficult topics, handling them with sensitivity and grace. It's a testament to the strength of the human spirit, even in the face of unimaginable pain.While some might find the ending bittersweet, it's a fitting conclusion to Lily's story. It's a reminder that sometimes the greatest act of love is letting go.""It Ends With Us"" is a must-see for fans of the book and anyone who appreciates a powerful story about love, resilience, and finding your own voice.",4
litscamaxn-82616,"A woman should have directed this. I respected the movie's intent but felt as if it was directed from a checklist: Black eye..check. Pushed down stairs..check, etc, etc. I admit, I haven't read the book, which I hope was more complete in expressing the trauma and individual terror that domestic violence inflicts on its victims. But although this film focuses on this truly important issue, I feel it missed the mark. Maybe it's an accurate translation of the book, and it's surely important to see a depiction of the horrible reality that exists today for many women. But just to depict that it exists, isn't enough.",3.5
regulusarcturusblack,"I've watched a lot of movies before, and I have definitely written a review only like a few minutes before, but I felt as if I kind of went off the rails, and wanted to review just a little more. First off, the premise of the overall story is incredibly boring and unoriginal - it feels like something that a Tumblr user in 2013 with a reading age of 11 could have written easily. Whatever this movie is, is an insult to cinema.Promoting it as a cute little rom-com, telling people to ""wear their florals"" to start a trend that would never exist in the first place is frankly embarrassing. The cast was . . . Curious, especially Blake Lively (isn't she around 10 years older than the character itself?) who I didn't get much from at all. I didn't pay much attention to the movie because it completely missed the point of capturing my interest, and this was just another common miss from Colleen Hoover.To whoever might be reading this, please do not watch this movie - or, God forbid, read this author's books. (Post scriptum, she looks exactly what I thought she would look like. Take that as you will.)",0.5
marinamolina-54099,"This is one of my favorite books and it covered most important events from the book, without changing any of the story. If you've read the book, you'll love it. (shonda rimes could learn a few things here 😅)
If you haven't, open your mind for this romantic drama that carries an important message for woman all ages.I loved the photography, all scenes super beautiful, wardrobe was spot on, direction was incredible, specially when we see the events happening as if it was a simple mistake and then at the end the ""blindfold"" is taken and she remembers as it was.I was a bit skeptical about Justin baldoni as the bad guy but he totally convinced me. Loved every minute of it.",5
jennifer12090,"Lot of potential here but as someone who lived through A LOT of domestic violence situations, watching Hollywood make it artsy so mainstream audiences can ""handle it"" to me really misses the mark of helping people understand what it feels like. I really enjoyed what this film tried to do but do not feel like it translated well to the big screen. Sure they were attempting to show gaslighting and whatnot, but I think you, the audience should have felt more powerful emotional response to what you were witnessing. I think we needed to hear more of the pain vs the silent flashbacks. Perhaps this could of been a part 1 and part 2 where in part 1 we stay in lillys high school years and learn more about her unstable home life and get a chance to bond with the character. Just wanted more than the film gave. At least it's creating an important narrative that isn't option talked about. Its a start...",3
VioletViolette,"Just like her husband. They're forever Serena Van Der Woodsen and Van Wilder. They have zero range.That would be fine if this story wasn't a deep one that people were looking at for representation and care. What Baldoni was TRYING to achieve.The talking through her lips/teeth is her only way of being able to talk, no matter the character. Even in The Town, the Boston accent was there but she's still Serena, putting on an accent.Blake is a liability to any story being told as she takes you out of it completely.A mess.

AfricanBro,"I went into this movie with no real expectations, I was just excited to catch a romcom in theaters. However, this turned out to be more of a romantic drama than a comedy. The story kicks off with a funeral, not the greatest vibes.The movie, though, was pretty nice. It reminded me of the romances from a while ago. I liked the underlying message, especially the scene where the title is referenced. The film could easily have felt sappy or trite, especially at that moment, but it managed to avoid that. It had many charming moments, particularly in the first half, even as it delved into the characters' traumas.The narrative feels like a journey of breaking family trauma, framed as a romance, particularly for the main character. The other two characters have their own issues to work through, but the focus remains on the protagonist. The movie provides just enough context to understand each character's background without overwhelming the story.Initially, I felt bad seeing two potential love interests, anticipating the usual heartbreak for one. However, the film subverted my expectations and shifted from a romantic comedy to a drama, avoiding typical clichés. The story ended up being more than just a love triangle, which I thought was nice.While the story wasn't groundbreaking and had its surface-level moments, it was emotionally impactful at times. All the characters had unresolved issues from their pasts, and by the end, we see the main character finally starting to heal. It felt like we watched her journey for two hours, and only at the end did she actually begin to take the right steps forward.Overall, it wasn't a must-see romance/drama, but it was still decent and worth watching if you have the time. My reaction at the end was more of a subdued ""good for her"" rather than being deeply moved. It's like being a cat person, watching a video of an injured dog taking its first steps; you feel happy for it and then just move on.I also think I was the only guy at that screening, felt like I wasn't meant to be there lol. Usually, you at least see a few guys who were dragged there by their girlfriends.",3
ilovellamasd,"People are watching the movie without knowing the story behind the book. It is not a romantic comedy! While there are romantic themes, this film addresses the complexities of Intimate Partner Violence and learning how to end the cycle of violence. This film gives beautiful credit to the book and was flawlessly executed! I hope both men and women stop asking ""why did they stay"" and instead ask ""why does this person abuse?"" If you or someone you know has been in a similar situation as Lily, you are not alone, and there are resources. If you notice you have some similarities with Ryle, please also get help.",5
ghangaskabir,"The first scene of the opens to the main characters meeting each other in intimate manner and exchanging deep truths.The theme of the movie unfolds quite quickly and gets easier to guess from thereon how it will proceed.Nevertheless keeps you engaged credit goes to the performances of the actor especially blake Lively who maintains a constant goodwill on the screen.The script is simple but with a message to put across, some scenes are too literal for conveying the message.The Characters are well built in terms of their standing.All in all it is a good one time watch, light hearted but with a straight forward message.",3.5
ahm-03797,"Trying to bring to life characters from such a well loved book to the big screen is a huge feat. And that is exactly what was done. The casting was perfection. I learned even more about these characters by seeing them on the big screen. @justinbaldoni could very well have cast someone else to play Ryle but there is no better a fit than him for this role. He embodies him. And @blakelively as Lily...incredible. All of the best lines from the book made it to the big screen and it was just as good, if not better than I could have imagined. Thank you for an amazing book to movie adaptation!!!!! I think I will see it a few more times! It was that good.",5
theognis-80821,"Some directors often shoot scenes that they have trouble cutting or shortening. They fall too easily in love with what they shot. And this screenplay suffers from the three biggest script problems:
1. Flashbacks
2. Coincidences
3. Arbitrary (versus obligatory) scenes.These weaknesses are ameliorated by strong performances by Blake Lively as Lily Blossom Bloom and the director/lead Justin Baldoni as Ryle (rhymes with ""rile"") Kincaid. And the excellent sets, costumes and decor provide a welcome distraction (the flower shop looks like it's from a fairy tale for elves, rather than a commercial establishment). (And would a grown man, who earns a living with his hands, reach into an oven to snatch a tray in which supper is burning without protection? Some writer is not ""cooking with gas."") For students of ""The Battered Woman"" by Dr. Lenore Walker, this domestic violence is rather minor, especially for 130 minutes of inaction. Greater insight into the nature of an abusive relationship would have been helpful. See ""Caught"" (1949).",3
ClassyCrystal,"Honestly all I can say is this is not accurate to the books at all and I understand that this usually happens with most book to movie adaptations but realistically when dealing with heavy themes like DV, assault and rape you would expect those themes to still be addressed in the movie.Colleen had zero issues romanticising and mentioning all those dark heavy themes in her original book but suddenly it's time for a KidzBop family friendly version. I wonder if she just wanted to impress Blake and get that Taylor record in there-so she allowed Blake Lively to take full control.You see, Justin B had a great creative direction with this adaptation but I have to assume things on set didn't go to plan and things changed.The rooftop scene is completely different from the original book but also from a lot of our memories.The message nonetheless is still very much there but it's definitely watered down as in they played safe.On the topic of playing safe, they also made sure to ensure that they keep within the time frame-was it a budget issue? Which I doubt.The pace was so fast, I was dizzy. In the books the pace was less fast than whatever the hell happened in the movie.I can summarise it in four sentences.There save ya money!When given an opportunity to rewrite history you could have added way more value towards the adapation. More insight on the trauma and the actual impact being a survivor has, the nights crying, the learning to love again, to trust again?Show us the reality not the haircare brand promos and the comedic touch.Only JB took this serious.JB was very serious about this.Anyway that's just my opinion.",0.5
abbigailvbarnes,"As a survivor of DV, I knew this movie would no doubt be triggering.. and it was... but the violence was done in a very artful, non-abrasive way, that leaves one more introspective than traumatised. Movies like this are IMPORTANT! To speak to and shine light on something that is very real for many of us. But it IS a movie, a story, so we want it to turn out better than real life often does.. and it didn't disappoint! It was moving, it was poignant, it was devastating and it was filled with hope. Hope that women are indeed extremely strong, and CAN make a new life for themselves and their children, which so many don't or never get the chance to. Hope that there are men out there who will protect and love you, just because they're truly good to their core.What I also loved about this movie, is that it showed the cycle incredibly well. It also showed how abusers often are broken people who need help. This in no way excuses abuse, but something twisted them up to be that way, and getting them help would often be more productive for the whole of society, and especially for their kids.Lastly, Blake Lively is just glorious. I am always mesmerised by her performance. She is breathtaking in a very real and approachable way. I applaud her courage for taking on such a heavy role and message to young women, one that I believe will make a real impact for good.",5
radaljmarta,"I genuinely felt disguist watching this movie (and not in connection with the plot, but the way the dialogues were written and how the actors acted). Even though I respect Blake Lively, this role was a failure, it simply did not fit her as an actress.I did not know anything about the movie but simply looked at the rating on Imbd and became interested when I saw there was a rating of 7.2. I did not pay attention that it was a small sample of people (or maybe people genuinely liked it and i do not understand it). On several occasions I had the urge to get out of the theatre, but gave it a chance, wish I did not because I find it difficult to find a good aspect of the movie (except maybe message, but it still was dealt with in a very shallow way).",1
steveinadelaide,"With the rise of domestic violence to a crisis level in our society, it is great to see a movie on our screens that deals with this issue. It Ends With Us, which has been adapted from the Colleen Hoover novel, is a poignant drama that explores the complexities of love, trauma, and resilience. We follow Lily Bloom after she moves to Boston to start a new life in the florist business. She meets a charming neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid, and quickly becomes romantically involved. As their relationship develops, Lily must deal with reminders of her troubled past and the possibility that her new relationship will lead to toxic patterns in the future.There are some strong performances in It Ends With Us. Blake Lively (The Age of Adeline and The Shadows), along with the rest of the cast, give us characters who are complex and emotionally charged. For me, Lively stands out and I particularly warmed to the character of Allysa, a friend and colleague who works with Lily in the florist shop, played by Jenny Slate. She brought some much-needed vitality and humour to the story.I do think that there could have been more development of Ryle's background. Lily's complex portrayal of a survivor grappling with trust issues is very good, but Ryle's character arc feels somewhat underdeveloped. I think this is a shame given that there has been little focus in our society on the motivations and histories of males who perpetrate violence. It Ends With Us does, though, provide some insight into an event in Ryle's history, which I will let you discover if you watch the movie.It Ends With Us tackles some very universal issues: love, loss, the search for identity, and, of course, domestic violence. The domestic violence issue is dealt with much more gently than it might have been, which may be okay given that there will probably be audience members who have, or are experiencing, domestic violence in their own lives. The cinematography visually reflects the emotional intensity of the story without being gratuitous in its portrayal of violence.If you regularly watch romantic dramas, you may find that some of the plot elements are very familiar. At over two hours, the movie does feel a bit too long, and a tighter narrative focus would have created a more intense experience, in my view. The emotional intensity sometimes borders on excessive melodrama, which may alienate some viewers.It Ends With Us is, in some ways, constrained by its rating, which recommends a lower-aged audience. But at least this allows for younger teens to be able to see a movie that is focused on an issue that is important for the age group in terms of their current and future relationships. It is a well-intentioned film that raises important issues, but its shortcomings prevent it from reaching its full potential. Nonetheless, it serves as a starting point for conversations about domestic violence and its devastating consequences. While It Ends With Us effectively addresses the pressing issue of domestic violence, its melodramatic tendencies and familiar plot hinder its potential to be a truly impactful film.",3.5
albaghliz,"This movie reminded me a lot of the classic romantic dramas from the 90s/2000s I loved that it took its time, I loved that it wasn't realistic but full of coincidences which made it charming to watch. I appreciate how it is a work of art fiction and we need that break from reality just and just enjoy it!The production, fashion design and over all look was very aesthetically pleasing. All of them looked absolutely stunning!But the real highlight of it all was the casting! Meer perfection! They all fit so well together, their energy and performance was what made it a 9 in my opinion!The twist at the ending of the title was the reason it got the 10 ! Made my heart gush! Loved it and would watch it again.",5
Ayupgeeza,"The cornerstone of this movie is domestic abuse, which is undoubtedly a challenging subject to cover in any depth in a couple of hours. It's all too easy to slip into stereotypes, to portray battered women as universally weak and vulnerable, and thus fail to penetrate the depths of a highly complex and nuanced subject.The film consequently deserves considerable credit for attempting to go beyond those paradigms, by trying to convey to the viewer how an otherwise strong and intelligent woman might find herself in an abusive relationship. This is undoubtedly a Hurculean task: achievable in a novel, perhaps, where every interaction, every moment, every character and every emotion can be painted in exquisite detail; but in a comparatively brief film it is almost impossible to address in any depth.Consequently, it's no surprise that the film fails to achieve its goals. Justin Baldoni's Ryle is creepy and disturbing more or less from the outset, and Blake Lively's Lily is far too worldly and intelligent to be as naive to the myriad red flags as she is. The relationship between the two key characters lacks any real depth, and instead feels like superficial lust between two beautiful people rather than any kind of love. The result is a series of scenarios that meander between the implausible and the downright peculiar, without ever really convincing.Lively's casting has been the source of some controversy. Her character would undoubtedly be more convincing if she were 23, as in the book, rather than in her late thirties. One is forced to wonder what she's been doing in her adult life up to the point she randomly decides to open a flower shop in Boston, and how all that life experience has apparently failed to prepare her for dealing with a hunky neurosurgeon with anger management issues.Still, for all its failures, the film offers plenty of value. In particular, it forces the audience to consider some key issues, such as how even the most intelligent people can blind themselves to the reality of their existence. It offers plenty of talking points, and promotes a debate that shows no signs of going away. The secondary cast, led by Jenny Slate's entertaining Allysa, is generally engaging and amusing, the production is slick and the set-pieces are well-executed.In short: it's not a great movie, but go see it anyway.",3
nfyg,"***NO SPOLIERS*** Go Ahead and ReadVery good adaptation of the film. Only downside was that the time line was abit off in comparison to the book, and also quite a few key details from the book which were missing. Think the casting between young Lily and adult Lily was great. I liked the way that the restaurant was called something different to what it is in the book, but how they tied it all together and still made the new restaurant name have meaning g and significance to the story. Also like how they actually used a very young baby for Emmie instead of pretending a 6 month old was a new born like they usually do in films :)",4
woodythegent,"You go into these types of films with certain expectations of silliness...these films are usually about as realistic as a Star Wars movie, but this one is particularly ridiculous. 3 beautiful physical specimens so wracked with angst and emotional baggage that they can't utter a word or make an expression without the weight of the world coming out. All single, all brilliantly successful, all physically gorgeous, BUT OHHHHHH THE ANGST!!!!!! THE UTTER PAIN OF EXISTENCE!!!!Sorry, but life life bears absolutely no relation to this movie. Start to finish the movie is trite, overly predictable, and overacted to the point where the scenes start to look like a final exam in acting school. It might be worth watching on cable, but it is too forgettable to waste money on in a theater.",2
paulmccomas,"In truth, I'd give this film 8 stars (my main complaint: too much non-diagetic music) -- but I'm giving it 10 in attempt to boost its overall rating, given that a lot of reviewers here JUST. DON'T. GET IT. You want the abuser to be irredeemably, 100% evil? To have HORNS growing out of his head? Not to excuse abuserd -- far from it! -- they actually DON'T have horns, and typically they've been through major trauma. This vertaily doesn't excuse their behavior, but perhaps it helps *explain* it. This film bravely wades through gray areas but still reaches the correct conclusion. Fine performances all around -- particularly from the actresses who portray BOTH Lilies.",5
gaaduunpaamaai,"This movie was so slow. Took so long to get to the point and, despite being over 2 hours long, lacked content.There was a plot there that may have been interesting had they just gotten to the point instead of this super slow progression.There was something off about this movie that made it hard to watch. And I'm not sure if the off thing was that the characters were just really horribly written, or that the acting was just terrible. But the characters were annoying and hard to watch.I went to see this because I had read All Your Perfects which was an okayish book but far from the best thing I've read this year.I decided to watch this before reading the book so I wouldn't annoy other people in the theatres getting mad at all the book to movie errors.",3
marisol_fc,"I knew this movie was going to be bad , but I didn't expected this level of bad , Blake Lively was an odd choice for this, her acting consist of saying yeah, followed by fake laughter and lip bitting followed by bad acting, the story gets boring really quickly and no amount of promotion and flowery dresses can make this appealing, there is ridiculous dialogue and her name is Lilly blossom bloom, that should tell you everything about the tone for the movie, also did she style her wardrobe her self? The outfits look like Carhartt sponsored the movie, wearing ridiculous overalls and excessive jewelry all the time, is this all in the book? How did they managed to make everything look so forced and out of place is beyond me.",0.5
reamaboucharaf,"I feel like this is one of those movies where I didn't necessarily have any problems with it, but still underwhelmed me a bit. Blake's acting was a little off at times, especially during the quirky-conversation scenes.I haven't read the novel so I can't critique the accuracy of this adaptation, but I know that those outfits were incredibly distracting, and kind of made the character feel a bit forced.Also I don't know if this is a hot take bc I don't want to be insensitive to DV victims/survivors, but I feel like the intense scenes weren't giving enough. It was enough for me to understand, but not to feel anything (in the sense that they were kind of short and surface, I didn't FEEL the urgency)I am typically a crier and I'm shocked this movie didn't get a tear out of me.I think this movie is good, but just that. It's kind of lacklustre and it just really felt like something was missing.",3.5
electra_opyrchal,"This movie was everything, how can so many of you be soooo unhappy/judgemental about it. Social media sucks the things so many women are saying about the movie just shows you guys will find anything! We should be uplifting and supporting this film and the actors not tearing women down because they missed this or they dress the character weird or her hair is wrong or i heard a girl say "" she looked so dusty and old"" like what??? How is that okay? I understand the book may not be exactly reflected but it was honestly soooo on point in my eyes and we should learn to be accepting i absolutely loved it the script was on point i loved lilys character i loved atlas and ryle and i just think the way social media is portraying the movie right now it will scare them into not making it a sequel and i cannot have that at all! Anyway i really hope they ignore all the negative nancies and make it starts with us because i would do just about anything to see that in my lifetime, lets find a way to be grateful we finally got <3.",5
iamianiman,"It Ends With Us really takes its time to build the story and let us get to know the characters, which is honestly one of its biggest strengths. The structure is solid, keeping us in the loop about Lily Bloom-her love life, how she met her best friend, and her past. The movie really makes you feel like you're on a journey with Lily, seeing the world through her eyes. It's her story, her POV, and that's what makes it so engaging. Sure, it can feel a bit slow at times, but the way Lily's life unfolds and how she handles everything kept us hooked.The main theme of the movie doesn't really kick in until the second half, but that buildup is actually kind of awesome. By the time it gets there, Lily and Ryle's relationship is already so developed that everything that happens after hits even harder. The deeper you get into the story, the more interesting it becomes. It's like a slow burn that just keeps getting better as it goes along.It Ends With Us also does a great job as a character study, especially for those who have gone through domestic violence and abuse. It gives a realistic look into why some women stay in abusive relationships, answering those tough questions like, ""Why doesn't she just leave?"" or ""Why not go to the police?"" It's eye-opening and gives you a new perspective on those tough choices.One thing we loved is how the movie balances Lily's relationships-not just with Ryle, but with her mom, her best friend, her best friend's husband, her ex, and her dad. Each character has a big impact on her life, both the good and the bad, making the story feel well-rounded and real.And let's talk about Lily Bloom herself. She's just so relatable-she loves flowers, enjoys dressing up, and has that elegant yet slightly shy vibe. By the end of the movie, she has this powerful, empowering moment that's all about breaking free and owning her life. It's one of those scenes that just makes you want to cheer her on.Now, on to some of the misses. The casting didn't really hit the mark for us. The actors don't quite match the characters we pictured from the book. If you imagined someone like Theo James as Ryle or Logan Lerman as Atlas, you might be a bit let down. The casting feels a little off, and that takes away from the authenticity.Another letdown was the costuming. The outfits didn't capture Lily's style the way the book described. Instead of that chic, ""less is more"" vibe, her wardrobe in the film felt kind of chaotic and uninspired. It just didn't do her character justice, and that's a shame.When it comes to the heavy themes of domestic violence and abuse, the movie handles it with care. They kept it minimal and avoided going graphic, which we respect, but that subtle approach might leave some viewers feeling like the message wasn't strong enough. Compared to more intense local shows, It Ends With Us might seem mild, but that doesn't mean it's any less important. We just wish they'd pushed it a bit further to make Lily's decisions pack more of a punch.In the end, It Ends With Us had the potential to be something even more powerful. It could've gone beyond the typical melodrama and really delivered stronger messages. They had the chance to switch things up, maybe even mix in some lighthearted moments like Parasite did before hitting us with the heavy stuff. But that opportunity wasn't fully taken, and the message ended up feeling a bit watered down.Verdict: It Ends With Us blossoms with compelling storytelling and nuanced character arcs, gracefully navigating the thorny issues of domestic violence and trauma. It offers a thoughtful character study of those who have endured such harrowing experiences. However, the casting and costume design wilt under scrutiny, missing some of the vibrancy that fans of the best-selling novel might expect. Despite not fully blooming into its potential, the film still delivers a bouquet of empowering moments, making it a must-watch, especially for women.",3
jessam-74363,"Justin Baldoni did an incredible job as Ryle Kincaid, I had never seen any of his acting roles before and I was blown away. He really aligned well with the character from the book! His portrayal of Ryle was incredibly balanced, you loved him at times, you were shocked by him at times.That said the fashion in this movie was very distracting, I love Carhartt as much as the next person, but it was beginning to feel like a paid sponsorship! It's been said that Ryan Reynolds always plays Ryan Reynolds in his films, so it was of no surprise that he wrote the roof top scene because it felt very much like Blake Lively playing Blake Lively.All in all, very comparable to the book!",4
prasadgollakota,"Could so easily have been on the wrong side of contrived, but this adaptation was well done. Casting was spot on. Chemistry worked well between the 2 sets of leads.One significant aspect which was conveyed well was that there is a story that underlies the behaviour of a perpetrator of violence. And whilst our initial reaction is to simply judge the action -- and there must absolutely be punishment -- we dont make progress without understanding why this happens and addressing root causes. The movie doesnt get into this but it doesnt need to. Violence is complicated and the movie does depict this.The most significant theme is the movie provides a model for how females should handle being in such situations. Easier said than done of course.And this leads to the only bit which was a bit unrealistic; how the situation was resolved. Seemed a bit swift and quite neat with a happy ending. Reality as most victims will know is things arent this neat.",3.5

The movie tries to be appealing in some sort of a sexual way but no, it doesn't work out.Definitely won't recommend to watch in theatres. I guess there are fans of the book who might see a deeper meaning in the plot but for the rest of us, it is utter waste of time.Please save your time and don't watch even if someone offers to show it to you for free.Not a love story, not a romantic movie, doesn't hit home.",1

This was the exception . Good acting , good story , now makes me want to go read the book . The first 30 minutes I didn't think I was going to like it but gradually got better and better and i honestly cared about the characters . The actors all did good in their roles . Not to go off topic but in our theater the ac broke and it was 80 degrees the entire movie (not exaggerating) and for me to still like the movie after leaving the theater drenched in sweat speaks volumes .

Murphaliciouss,"I've read the book before seeing the movie. I did enjoy the movie, but it was terribly whitewashed for some reason. Although you could see the passion between Lily and Ryle, it did not fully delve into the dark side of their romance which I felt did an injustice to the book. The magnet, the books, the absolute cruelty of Ryle's behaviour whilst he was racked with his demons and Lily's trauma of her reliving her parents relationship was glossed over for what? A PG rating? I understand the movie only has limited time, but it could've been a much more powerful message but missed the mark. I must admit Justin Baldini was spot on as Lyle.",3.5
jamiemcpherson-78878,I had not heard of the novel this is based on but I like ( a little more than like) Blake Lively as although she is stunningly beautiful she is a very fine actor.I had also not heard of the lead/actor director and wow is he a good looking man who can also act.I said to my partner after coming out who also thoroughly enjoyed it 'imagine going through life' looking like that ( him & her) a definite unfair advantage and then talent on top.I guess if I had wanted too I could have guessed most of the plot and the meetings or re connections but I don't care. I went to a Cineworld in the UK who are struggling financially at the midday ish showing on a hot Sunday and I absolutely loved the movie and although sad and covering a difficult subject matter I left the cinema thinking yes that's what I want to see more of not robots that turn into cars or super heroes who can't die and then if they do they come back to life.The very best movies are about stories and characters that you care about and I liked the story and loved the characters.I thought the whole cast was excellent but the two lead actors were fantastic and totally made the movie a big box of tissues experience.I have since read about infighting between the cast and the Director with Blake wanting to take the movie in a different direction with the author on her side but you couldn't tell from the intimate scenes and the chemistry on show but hey I guess that's good acting.Anyway with cinema dying a little this is the type of movie I want to see like The Holdovers an absolute gem of a movie that moves you and makes you feel alive so congratulations to all involved and I hope if the rumours are true you can all start following each other again.,4.5

I went to the movie from word of mouth about the book being a bestseller.Blake lively is a good actress but i felt zero chemistry between her and the male main character (who also happens to be the director of the movie)I got bored about 30 mins in.. my sister kept reminding me that blake lively is actually pregnant while filming this movie and how she's managing to hide her baby bump..The movie was a bit dull but i won't say it was terrible oh no.. it was watchable and made me want to read the book to compare..Hope you enjoy it!",3
kailanibass,"As an avid reader who has navigated the often treacherous waters of page to film adaptations, I've encountered my fair share of disappointments. Colleen Hoover's 'It Ends with Us' is a novel I hold close to my heart, so naturally, I approached its movie adaptation with both excitement and apprehension. I feared the film might not do justice to the powerful emotions and intricate character dynamics that made the book so compelling. There were some details missing, many details that I found important and had hoped to see in this movie BUT to my pleasant surprise, the movie not only met but exceeded my expectations; not every film adaptation can be exactly like it's book, right? In my opinion the filmmakers have crafted a beautiful adaptation that, although not perfect, does captures the essence of the story and its characters. Much like the novel, the film strikes a delicate balance between sadness, hope and humor, drawing viewers into the emotional whirlwind that defines Lily's journey. The performances were heartfelt and you can feel that, the direction sensitive, and the screenplay stayed true to the heart of CoHo's work. The movie is not just a retelling but an experience that resonates deeply, much like the book did. I found myself fully immersed in the story all over again, and I will definitely be watching it again. Here's hoping we get to see an adaptation of 'It Starts with Us' in the near future!",4.5
emmarocksmorethanyou,I was pleasantly surprised with this film. I thought Lively performed well and was able to pull off the role. I thought the film took the subject matter seriously while not being too dark at the same time. I have not read the book but I thought the movie it was a decent watch. I would watch it again if it was free and just playing on the TV. The soundtrack kind of bothered me at times and I felt like it didn't fit the scenes. I laughed out loud when Skinny Love was played. Why are we still using that song in 2024? Anyway.... much better than I thought it would be. Shame the cast had such a hard time with the press.,3
ohgabrielle,"Not only was it the most boring movie i've ever watched, but the main actresses acting is not great, her outfit choices were incredibly distracting, the message of DV was not even there and it was a poor portrayal of real life DV.I did not read the book but the person I want to see the movie with did and even they were shocked at how horribly done this movie was. The setting for the movie was good and the other actors did an amazing job. I really hope they don't waste people's time with the sequel. If they do I won't be watching. This could have been done way better with a better lead actress and better writing/styling. I want my money back.",0.5
Anurag-Shetty,"It Ends with Us is based on the novel of the same name, by Colleen Hoover. Lily Bloom(Blake Lively) gets through her traumatic childhood & starts a new life. She meets a neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid(Justin Baldoni) & sparks fly. However, Lily realizes that there are some aspects of Ryle that make her think about her parents' relationship.It Ends with Us is a phenomenal film. Director & actor Justin Baldoni pulls the perfect double duty & has given us a movie that's romantic, emotional, charming & also captures the dark elements of Colleen Hoover's source material, perfectly. There are several scenes that will make you tear up or shed a tear or two. The performances are the highlight of the film. Blake Lively is the star of the show, as Lily Bloom. Lively steals the show in every scene she's in, with her awe-inspiring performance. Justin Baldoni is brilliant as Ryle Kincaid. Jenny Slate is fantastic as Allysa. Hassan Minhaj is good as Marshall. Brandon Sklenar is spectacular as Atlas Corrigan. Isabela Ferrer & Alex Neustaedter are amazing as Young Lily Bloom & Young Atlas Corrigan, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. It Ends with Us is a must watch for fans of romantic dramas. It will break your heart & mend it by the end so, it's a rollercoaster ride of emotions that's definitely worth taking.",5
omallieharp,"There have been countless think pieces and viral trends centered around discussing everything from the onset behavior of It Ends With Us' principal players to the way the film depicts domestic violence; unfortunately, all of the commotion created an audience much larger and more robust than the material deserves.Underneath glowing lights, bright colors, and an aggressively modern soundtrack, there's a very lazily told story of a flower shop owner named Lily Blossom Bloom and the whirlwind relationship she finds herself in with a neurosurgeon named Ryle. Over time, Lily discovers aspects of Ryle's personality that remind her of the way she watched her late father treat her mother up until his death.The one element of the film that I genuinely appreciated from an artistic perspective were the early editing choices that make Lily into an unreliable narrator. I did not read the full book so I am unsure if that was a decision made prior to Justin Baldoni's vision, but I really felt like it made Lily's rose-colored glasses and internal gaslighting more understandable.I attended the movie with my friend who is a DV survivor and I trust her perspective on that experience far more than any of my own so I will include the following: To It Ends With Us' credit, my friend said she hadn't seen many movies or shows that represented the type of relationship she used to be in at all and that IEWU ""felt very familiar.""However much I appreciate having a film with the message that you can always be the one to end an abusive cycle (even saying so in the title), I cannot firmly say that I think that It Ends With Us is entirely responsible. Most of my gripes with IEWU are rooted in the marketing and promotion, but two things are missing from the actual run time that would significantly reduce my suspicions that something is off about this whole production.That would be the decision not to warn any of the women in the audience of the potentially triggering content on a screen before the film and the further decision not to offer resources to any of the women in the audience who may be the real life Lily Blooms of the world. Reckless and selfish marketing willing to risk the mental health of the audience members the ""messaging"" seems to champion will never draw me in or ever come off as edgy.At the end of all of this and the social media firestorm, I'm left wondering who this movie was even made for, if not other Lily Blooms? And if it really was made for Lily Blooms, why has so little care gone into their experience with the film? I just don't buy it.",3
bvzzwdsdp,"The film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's It Ends With Us closely mirrors the book's flaws, which itself suffers from a lack of depth and originality. Tailored for a younger audience drawn to superficial trends, the narrative loses much of its impact on screen, retaining teenage clichés and uninspired dynamics. Both the book and the film rely on worn-out tropes common in countless forgettable chick flicks and teenage dramas. Although the story's attempt to address the critical issue of domestic violence is sincere, it is treated superficially and lacks the necessary depth. The cast's performances fail to bring the required nuance to the material, resulting in a film that exemplifies the unfortunate trend of giving undue attention to productions of mediocre quality.",1
johnalagoz,"It Ends With Us is a 2024 romantic drama film based on the best selling novel of the same name and stars Blake Lively as Lily Bloom, who starts a relationship with a neurosurgeon that isn't as charming as you expect to be. Then things start to take a downward spiral when a former lover of Lily's works at a restaurant and then the now husband neurosurgeon starts to get angry and then the film starts to go full throttle.The good thing about this film that really starts to be promising is it's atmospheric build up to scenes that in, most romantic movies, are unconvincing acting-wise but It Ends With Us doesn't have a problem with it's realistic portrayal of domestic abuse and sexual assault that are actually well handled and realistic of caring individuals around the protagonist that makes for uncomfortable, but powerful viewing.Lot's of aspects and actual humane body language is enough to make this quite a different watch from most of the films in the cinema now and it's most certainly a impressive achievement and my respects to all the crew involved. So why is this flawed? Unfortunately the film is very rushed and unfinished. While this might be hard to capture with a film that has a fairly long runtime of just over 2 hours, it's a really big hole to the film's already impressive résumé so I found this quite disappointing. The wedding is literally just 2 seconds and then the film skips years later and that's what I really don't like is that pivotal scenes lack any sort of background regarding the events that take place on a screen.Also the neurosurgeon (who's played by the film's director) is very wooden and out of place. He's one of those copy and paste generic handsome ooh lala boys that have no acting range and he was very cliché in general. I much preferred the other guy who actually has some sort of presence and he has great chemistry with our protagonist, and same with the rest of the supporting cast.Overall while having it's downsides, It Ends With Us is certainly a interesting film that had me entertained and it pretty much succeeds most of my expectations, which I can't say much for romantic movies.Grade: A.",3
tammybose,"After reading some reviews on this one before heading to the theater i had low expectations, but they were proved wrong. The story flowed well and each scene was compact with nothing more needed and nothing less, to move tge story along. Blake's acting was excellent and i felt her fear vividly. The male lead i had seen in Jane the Virgin series and i thought he portayed the role well, I went back and forth between live and hate repeatedly. The movie asks a question that is relevant for all of us: Why do we stay with, and sometimes even marry, people who hurt us? A rarely told theme and the message at the end we all need to hear.",4.5
rgkarim,"LIKES:Beautiful AtmosphereFantastic ActingGreat Setting To Play InHandles the Material TastefullyLiked the Transition PointsPacing Is GoodEmotionally FulfillingDISLIKES:Sort of UnderwhelmingFeels A Bit ScatteredPace Gets UnevenI Feel There Was More To Be ToldThe Ending Is Mixed For MeThe VERDICT/SummaryA story like this will be one of reflection, inner beauty, and some spiritual lifting that will be an anchoring point for the audience. Baldoni's direction accomplishes a lot of the latter, unleashing a torrent of beauty in the movie's atmosphere in cinematography, sound editing, and design. Fantastic acting by the leads with good writing helps to emphasize the strength that comes from trials, utilizing both verbal and nonverbal styles to convey the suffering that arises with trauma such as this. Lively in particular just handles things with such class, working with the book's story to handle the material tactfully, even though there were more avenues to explore regarding domestic violence. The rest of the cast accomplishes much, Slade being supportive but silly, while Baldoni plays his antagonistic role with confidence, build, and believable behaviors of such an abuser. I found the pacing good, the transitions between past and present helping to break up the story into elements that are slightly happier with their young cast acting solidly to explain Lily's story. Together, all of this combines into a movie that is very emotionally fulfilling and left many in my showing crying at the spectacle they witnessed. Though I might be a robot, I have to give my nods for the poetic journey they took us on in the two-hour runt time.For the spiritual grace success, the story however took hits for me in this movie. I have not read the book, but I feel much of the content was lost in the translation to the silver screen. Despite a good pace, the movie does feel uneven at times, dragging during the setup moments only to quickly fly over the intense moments. I felt a bit robbed that some of those challenges seemed overcome and simplified in this film, never truly feeling the struggle that comes with such moments in life. Much of the transitions were good for me, but then sort of petered off with the memories at the end practically gone, and very disappointing to not see more with the build-up from the earlier moments. The organization also felt a bit scattered at times, with a linear story to follow, but at the same time inconsistently executed and felt difficult to perfectly outline everything in their lives that a book has so much more time to organize. Again, I could follow the story for the most part, but it did not have the full kick and emotion that this movie so amazingly captured. So many events just sort of happened within the confines of the movie runtime, especially at the end, which felt too hasty, underwhelming, and a tie-off that again made me feel cheated.Overall, the movie was fine for me, enough beauty and emotional fortitude that a night out with a group of friends, a girls' night, or some sort of church/organization meeting would be the ideal audience for a theater visit. Though, in terms of story, the book is most likely the avenue to take to get the full impact of this taxing tale and content. From all of these components, my scores for the movie are:Drama/Romance: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5.",3.5
ialbufalah,"2 boring hrs of no dialog!! Just cheesy romance thats 90% sexual ( i dont even know why and how they fell in love)! Terrible terrible. Just because the idea is about abusement DOESNT MAKE IT DEEP.Every now and then I hoped that some event is gonna happen that's gonna twist the story. I have no idea why is this movie two hours? And not even one good dialogue or one good deep conversation.If you wanna know how cheesy is the movie, just by the actress name: Lilly Blossom Bloom, and she owns a flower shop. SERIOUSLY? I cant. That's beyond lame.Anyway, no good comes of nowadays best seller fictions.",0.5
kjlm-38806,"Reading the book I loved the concept of what the film portrays, without spoiling the idea of perspective on a situation and how being in love can completely change it.I loved the cast just starting off with that, how Blake lively has such a powerful kind of beautiful vibe to her showing off truly in the film. Then jenny slate plays a perfect best friend roll, seeming so supportive at it all.I think TikTok overhyped this film a lot for me unfortunately, people saying how it shifted there perception of relationships but I didn't get that from it. But I do love the story it's painted getting traction to things that people don't realise happened often.Lastly, I love talking about the cinematography in films and this film itched my brain in the perfect way, with the shots being so beautiful but stretching from incredible skylines to breathtaking landscapes, the only side of the cinematography I wasn't a huge fan of was the kissing as a man who doesn't love pda it's probably one of the first films of this category I've watched in public and imo I won't do it againOverall a great watch.",4
sschmid-29739,"A romantic drama which works well in cinema.. There's no need to wait for it, to be watched at home..I am not a huge fan of Lively, but.. although not an Oscar performance, she surprised me here... very well and emotional acted.It was no surprise that the cinema was filled with women, only 2 guys who were probably dragged along by their girlfriends.All in all a good, entertaining watch, with very decent actors. Not sure about ""Atlas"" though..
I did not read the book, but films usually tend to disappoint if they are based on one.With the exception of Bridget Jones of course 😉.Enjoy !!",3.5
camillecalderon-90715,"Don't waste your time going to see this movie! It's just a huge waste of time!I didn't read the book but I was aware it was a movie about domestic violence so was expecting something quite deep, yet the characters and story line have no depths to them whatsoever.The acting also didn't help, I know Blake Lively from Gossip Girl and throughout this movie she was just portraying the exact same character as in Gossip Girl...! The story in itself is also very romanticised, I guess to make it a little lighter but it's a shame because they had the opportunity to do something significant about an important topic and completely missed the mark!",0.5
jp_91,"""It Ends with Us"" is a dramatic-romantic film that manages to provide a strong message against domestic violence. The script, based on the novel of the same name written by Colleen Hoover, is tremendous, being emotional and raw. Justin Baldoni does a daring job as director and actor, while Blake Lively is moving and sympathetic, masterfully taking her character to different emotional states. The cast also includes Brandon Sklenar giving a charismatic character, and Jenny Slate with a friendly and fun character. The cinematography is spot on without being jaw-dropping. The editing work is excellent, it wonderfully mixes the past and present of the main characters, giving a perfect audiovisual narrative to the script. ""It Ends with Us"" is a great movie with a positive and direct message for both women and men.",5
geancarlocalderonr,"It's obvious this wasn't the director's cut, as has been publicly acknowledged. However, the message and the heart behind it were still conveyed. We can break the cycle of abuse, starting with ourselves. The acting was decent, and the cinematography was average, but the message is strong and almost clear, except for some cheesy lines that, according to Blake Lively, were written by her husband.While ""It Ends With Us"" is often praised for its raw portrayal of domestic abuse, the romantic elements in the story feel overly dominant, sometimes overshadowing the critical message the book is trying to convey. The narrative delves deeply into the complexities of love and relationships, but in doing so, it occasionally loses sight of the more pressing issue of domestic abuse.",3.5
prettymuchalways,"The film is an important one, of course. I think anything that exposes violence against women and gets people talking, is important...Firstly, the Positives:
The overwhelming positive for me was actually kind of life-changing, and deeply personal, but maybe for others also. The napkin. The eulogy. Five things you loved about your father. I'm 45 and have been carrying my whole life the fact that my father loves nothing about me. He admitted as much in a family counselling session when I was in my twenties, but it has been a known fact in my family for my whole life, and a defining aspect of my life and my personality I think, that neither my father or mother loves anything about me.It's always been about that. Always. About how I am the problem. I am unlovable. I almost can't believe that it's taken a romantic movie for me to realise that, hang on, what do I love about him?? Why has that not been a question asked by me or anyone else? Why has it only been *my* loveability that has always been questioned, in my mind and in theirs, even other family members that pretend they don't take sides. Wow. Mind blown.The negatives: husband is portrayed as a victim. I felt for him with his history of course, but it did feel like he just walked away from his crimes.Just my view. Others might be more appreciative of the ""balanced view"" of violence against women. Perhaps that was the aim - to be more palatable and appealing to the ""not all men"" crowd.The other negative I felt was how neatly it ended with him just leaving the room calmly.I'm sorry, but, as if.Not all men, but always men.",3.5
bmightyy,"I read the book 1 week before seeing the movie, so, the book was FRESH in my mind and I was baffled by how badly they orchestrated this film. It felt like a music video art project that completely missed the mark. Pacing is off, key parts of the book completely left out, the way things happened in the movie do not coincide with what happened in the book. They've added parts to the movie that aren't in the book. Even the language they use is different from the book.Even without reading the book this movie was bad. It romanticized domestic abuse with hot people and fantasy. I've seen better Hallmark movies.Wouldn't recommend to any romantic.",0.5
kevin_robbins,"My wife and I recently watched It Ends with Us (2024) in theaters. The storyline follows Lily, who had a troubled childhood marked by her father's abuse towards her mother. A highlight of her youth was helping a homeless boy next door, with whom she falls in love and loses her virginity to, just before a tragic event causes them to lose contact. Years later, Lily opens a flower shop in Boston, meets a surgeon who becomes the love of her life, and seems to be living the dream-until she runs into the homeless boy from her childhood, now a successful man who is eager to rekindle their old flame.This film is directed by Justin Baldoni (Five Feet Apart) and stars Blake Lively (Gossip Girl), Justin Baldoni (Five Feet Apart), Jenny Slate (Marcel the Shell with Shoes On), Hasan Minhaj (The Daily Show), and Brandon Sklenar (Vice).This is a fantastic film with a deeply engaging premise, that is well-paced and thoughtfully presented to the audience. The movie explores deep themes and offers an authentic, albeit sad, depiction of relationship challenges and their impacts across generations within a family. There's a lot to see and absorb here. The acting is phenomenal, with everyone delivering realistic performances. Lively is particularly outstanding and will likely receive awards and accolades for her role. She was fantastic from beginning to end.I have a bit of a bias towards the Maine-to-Boston transition subplot, as it resonates with my own experiences growing up, and this film does a great job with that depiction. Every flashback scene was well-executed, the attire was spot on, and the cinematography was excellent. The story is presented beautifully, with an ending that effectively drives home the film's central message. I only docked a couple of points due to a few dialogue sequences that missed the mark, but overall, this is still a fantastic watch.In conclusion, It Ends with Us delivers a tough storyline brilliantly and is definitely worth your time. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",4
eimbier,"A Blake Lively produced film. She stars in it, a favorite actress of mine, not as much here. Confusing direction in the opening few minutes appeared as though the film was projecting Hollywood social and sexual standards to Maine and Boston localities. I argued with myself not to walk out of the film after the first half hour. Time jumps were confusing, as I couldn't be sure it was a time jump, with each micro reveal. However, it took watching much of the film to understand Lily's psyche and to stew in her anguish. Great storyline; the book maybe better; the film is very worth seeing. Resist from reading plot summaries before seeing it.",3

Format: regular theatreI walked into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about the novel, the story or characters, and I haven't even seen the trailer or read the synopsis beforehand. However, I am aware of its popularity among readers due to the novel that carries the same title. Moreover, I have read about all the different issues that the production of this film went through.The film was totally better than what I expected. Again, I haven't read the novel so I don't know how the film could've dealt with the story in any other way. All I can say is that the film was able to handle the story and keep it tight together in a way that made it very engaging. At some times the script feels rushed, specially that the film jumps back and forth through different time periods. More content could've been shown to perhaps support the story and win the audience's sympathy like showing more scenarios or interactions between characters.Justin Baldoni really well directed the film. From the chosen camera angles to the way that each scene was built to reveal a climax at the end of it. Baldoni was able to control every watcher's emotions and feelings, all through his vision. On the other side, his acting as Ryle Kincaid is unfortunately a miss. At most times, he seemed like he was trying way too hard to act a good scene. Therefore, every scene that had both Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, seemed so weird because one is acting so good and the other wasn't. The casting choice of young Lily Bloom might be the most accurate and perfect casting choice ever, due to the similarity that she has with Blake Lively herself, they look almost identical.The music and soundtrack of this film is a total hit. Perfect song choices for every scene that the lyrics of every song almost matches up with the story of the film and connects to it. Cherry by Lana Del Rey, Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby by Cigarettes After Sex, and White Iverson by Post Malone. The soundtrack included every pop hit and fan favorite song and was just thrown in this film.",3.5
sashasmith-61425,"I actually haven't read the book and was inspired to see the movie from social media reviews. I knew a little bit about the controversy surrounding the movie but I actually had no idea what the plot of the movie was until I got to the theater. Overall I thought it was a pretty good film. I saw a lot of people criticizing Blake Lively's performance but I honestly think she did better than I expected. I absolutely love Justin Baldoni since Jane the Virgin and he also did a really good job playing his character, so much so it was hard for me to hate him.However, the film focuses a lot of the plot through flashbacks, leaving us to wait and hope for it all to make sense. When they connected the dots after a long run time of over 2 hours, it kind of left me feeling underwhelmed. I haven't read the book personally, but I heard that it was way more emotional and intense. I felt while watching the movie that they were holding back and they could've went further to show us the ugly truths of a situation like that a little more than they did. Knowing the controversy and everything going on behind the scenes I think Justin Baldoni did the best he could but this movie failed to evoke the emotion from me that I thought it would. Ryles sister and her husband were good side characters though as well as Atlas.",3.5
CVB-2000,"I read this book 2 years ago and when I found out that it was being made into a movie, I was super excited. I absolutely loved the book and couldn't wait to see the movie. I was not disappointed. This is a romantic drama so anybody who goes into it thinking otherwise may be disappointed. Definitely not a romcom and nowhere is it labeled as such, to my knowledge. What it is, is a beautiful yet heartbreaking story and, with the exception of a few small changes, it is very true to the book.Movie adaptations always have changes from the book. I know a lot of people were upset about the age difference in the main characters between the book and movie. Colleen Hoover has explained that if you read her interviews! I love Blake Lively (since Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants days), Justin Baldoni (from Jane the Virgin) and Brandon Sklenar (1923, ooh la la) so I had no issues with this. All actors played their characters to a T!I cried at the end, even though I knew the ending already. As I said before, beautiful yet heartbreaking and so very good. Highly recommend!",5
alexandrokroger,"I just saw this film in the theatre. Even tough it's not the first film to tackle abuse within relationships it managed to do so with a lot of heart in it (it was not about revenge, only about kindness).By the end of the film, many in the theatere cried.(and I live in Sweden, where it's not common to show emotion in public, this film got to peoples hearts)I was very impressed by the performance of Blake.

royalpumpkinart,"I am wayyyyyy more critical than moat of book-to-film adaptations, and this one was picture perfect. It sped up when it needed to, but didn't rush the story or the timeline in a way that felt forced. The acting was incredible, especially from Justin and Brandon. Blake was the perfect choice and although I think her wardrobe was wayyyyyyyy off at times, I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see it again. The only thing I would change is that horrendous Taylor Swift song. We all knew it was in the film, but having to listen to the whole thing during such pivotal scenes was uncomfortable. Pay attention to Allyssa's birthday party, there's a nice cameo among the guests.",5
elsiebobek,"Like my title says, this movie betrays every single domestic violence victim and survivor. I haven't read the book and have to go on faith that it handled the matter more tastefully than the movie did.The problem with the film is that it doesn't just depict how what at first appeared like a solid relationship turning volatile but it romanticizes it.Instead of a drama that grows more tense as the control mounts, we get a rom com that manages to make the aggressor more relatable than the victim; if only due to Blake Lively's annoying performance. Instead of empathizing with the victim, all she did was elicit eyerolls from me. That alone is an absolute tragedy and speaks to the low quality acting and screenwriting.I'd only seen Blake Lively in ""The Shallows,"" and suddenly, I realized that that role required no acting at all. Just physical fitness. ""It Ends With Us"" reveals her lack of depth, her inability to empathize with the downtrodden, the abused.Lively giggles, eyes sparkly, and like Paris Hilton once upon a time uses her fake soft public persona voice to say, ""Mhmmm,"" she looks up doe-eyed at her abuser, purrs seductively...good grief. Even the - carefully worded due to censorship - almost ""coerced intimacy"" is portrayed in too much of an inappropriate 50 Shades way to take too seriously or to have a profound emotional impact.In a bizarre turn of events, we saw Lively promote the movie as a romcom, too. She advised in a tweet to grab your girls and your florals and go see it. Domestic violence has devolved to a girls' night out wearing pretty floral dresses. I rest my case on her privilege of not being able of empathizing with hardship and heartbreak. If you watch old interviews with Julia Roberts about ""Sleeping With The Enemy,"" she was a decade younger than Lively and yet handled the promotion with such grace, so professionally. It's worlds apart.The cinematography is forgettable, as are the actors. Nothing is too bad or good to leave a lasting impression. I have no idea why this had to be two whole hours long. There's virtually not enough story to even fill an hour. The rest is just fluff and love songs.",0.5
monsterb-72498,"I read the book and I have to say, the movie really brought all the characters to life in such an amazing way- even better than my imagination did! Blake Lively did a phenomenal acting job and was perfect for the part. Her kind, yet strong and witty character is incredibly lovable and her chemistry with both Ryle's character and Atlas' character is so good. The movie portrayed Baldoni's character in a very tasteful way. It's a hard subject to shed light on but it was done beautifully. I really felt heartbroken for Ryle, given his own past loss and the demons he battled in his own life. Allysa's character (Lilly's best friend and sister to Ryle) gave us some comic relief with her humor. Young Lilly is literally like a little twin sister... I don't know how they found someone that perfect for the role! It's not easy turning a great book into an amazing movie, but they pulled it off. There were some scenes that were left out, however, that doesn't hugely detract from the movie or the message and overall story line. Well done. I thought it was fabulous!",5
feetuennermann,"As someone who read the book and had certain ideas and expectations, I found the film very good.Of course, it was clear that not ALL important plot points could be packed into one film. But the film still summed everything up well. I find the negative reviews very unfortunate, it is clear that not everything fits into 2 hours and 10 minutes.Personally, I didn't think it was a bad thing that the actors were older than the book characters. The film and the story behind it weren't meant to convey a teen romance rather to draw attention to a serious topic. A topic that can come up in any social class.",4.5
filmschoolgre,"I went into this movie expecting it to be worse than it actually was, i read the books and they did miss a lot of details but as a person that knows film so many scenes and refill of the book has to be cut of because of the screen time. Now the narrative portrait was slow at first and really fast at the end, which is something i didn't like, they changed the age of the characters and i hated that when i first heard of it, in spite of that it turned out to be actually better for them to play with the past and presence timeline but come on couldn't they at least taken the mustage of atlas away, i would of liked to see more of Ryle apologising and crying because of his actions like in the book, i felt since the hitting started the finale just got rushed and would like to see more of those scenes like the book did, didn't feel like the aggression and DV is the main plot here, didn't see them take this issue more in dept just saw more of a romantic movie at first which that's okay because we need a bit of backstory but it just got slow and they could of use the time to cut some of it and be more in dept with the main topic, now talking more about the shots and picture they did a good job, there were some scenes where i didn't like the lighting and the camera moving but overall the shoots were good and better than i was expecting, i liked some of the costumes the characters were wearing but sometimes it looked like the costume design department definitely got lost.",3
kostadinova_aneta78,"Please, save your money and buy the book instead. They presented the story in such a shallow way that youd think it something you shouldn't pay attention to, because its fun and normal and it happens but you need hope. Like no Blake, its not about hope its about fighting and going back and forth, you shouldve at least spoken to someone or google whats DV! Please she is so out of touch when playing, never aligned facial expressions with the actual situation, most important parts of the book were cut off? If youve seen the confession of a marriage counselor movie youd know how to present a story like this. The outfits?? DISASTER. The plot lasting for 5 mins?? DISGRACEFUL. I never thought id see the day where id bash blake but if you read the book and then watch the movie, youd know that the dhar mann stories on youtube have better plot and acting.My friends and I all left absolutely disappointed.",1
bradlles,"HONEST REVIEW!!!As a guy who doesn't usually go for ""girls' movies,"" I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say, this film completely blew me away! From the very beginning, it was clear that this movie had something special. The characters were incredibly well-developed, the plot was engaging and from what my partner tells me everything is like the book.The humor was spot on, the emotional moments were heartfelt, and the overall message was inspiring without being heavy-handed. I found myself fully invested in the story and rooting for the characters and the chemistry between the cast was undeniable.I left the cinema with a big smile on my face, and I genuinely hope there's a sequel in the works. This film proves that great storytelling can transcend any genre labels, and I believe it has something for everyone regardless of gender. Don't miss out on this gem and for mine and my partners sake please make ""it starts with us"" as the next movie.",5
isaacsundaralingam,"Justin Baldoni's ""It End with Us"" could at times be as melodramatic as it is attractive, but what it undeniably is, is a decent look into the effects of domestic violence and generational trauma. Since release, the movie has been subject to a lot of behind the scenes drama that I'm not going to focus on here, and instead just approach it for the movie that it is.Starring Blake Lively as Lilly Bloom, the movie sees her falling in love in 2 different stages of her life... Both instances somehow being impacted by her experiences with domestic violence. I've heard complaints about how much the movie deviates from the book it's based on, but having never read the book myself (nor even aware of its existence before the movie), I was rather content with the movie I watched. While it at times does play up the melodrama to cringe worthy levels, the underlying approach to such a heavy subject is done with tact, and that makes the movie a decent watch overall.""It Ends with Us"" is about as young adult romance as it could get, with all the clichés and stereotypes of the genre on full display, and that in itself could mean that it's mostly going to appeal to a particular demographic. And that's a good thing perhaps, because while I did find it interesting, it's not good enough to warrant me recommending it to most people. It's a movie that will be liked by those who usually enjoy cutesy romantic young adult dramas, and would at best be white noise to anyone else.",3
clairehenry-63001,"Going into this film I was unsure of whether it would meet my expectations. I definitely wanted it to follow the book closely; which I must say, I was NOT disappointed. I personally loved the casting, wasn't sure if I would like Brandon Sklenar as Atlas, but I was shockingly in love as soon as he spoke. This movie made it feel like I was reading the book for the first time again! I was teary-eyed and smiling the whole time. I think this film is a wonderful adaptation of the book, which if you haven't read I highly recommend! Obviously they couldn't include all of the past moments with Atlas into the film (my fav parts) but I think they did a good job with the amount that they put in there. Overall, stunning movie that I will be watching a million times over.",4.5
CinemaSerf,"""Lily"" (Blake Lively) is supposed to give an eulogy at her father's funeral, but she can't. Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon ""Ryle"" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's ""Allysa"" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with ""Atlas"" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When ""Ryle"" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of ""Lily"" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama. It's disappointing.",3
stef-leblanc,"I read the book a while back, and while it was decent, it didn't leave a lasting impression on me. So, I walked into the theater to see the movie adaptation with zero expectations. I'm glad I did because what unfolded on the screen completely blew me away.Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni delivered performances that were nothing short of spectacular. They brought depth and emotion to their characters in a way that I wasn't prepared for, and their chemistry was palpable. The movie had me feeling a wide range of emotions-joy, heartbreak, hope, and everything in between.This film turned out to be one of my favorite movies of the year, hands down. It's a must-see, and I highly recommend it!",4.5
vjrsb,"Even though the acting and some of the lines are amazing. It didn't get to me as much as I thought it would I read the book and I didn't think it was life-changing so I really didn't expect much. However it is a good movie to watch. The film also forgets to include important scenes and details from the book that are crucial to maintain the plot of the story. My favorite character was Allysa, Jenny Slate's acting was really good and I was amazed to see after her previous movies she has evolved. I described it as Meh because personally it is not a life changing for me but I thoroughly believe that it taught me things. P. S: Some lines and the message was really good.",3
jared-25331,"Just got done watching It Ends with Us (2024) and it was really boring.Positives for it Ends with Us (2024):
The performance from both Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni are pretty decent in this movie.Negatives for It Ends with Us (2024):
First off this movie was 2-hour long and there is version of this movie where I wouldn't be bother by that, but it feels like this movie is stretching out the plot in the most agonizing ways possible. I didn't cared about the romance between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Throughout the runtime, I was just sitting in my seat and I was like like"" I don't care about any of this. End credits happen alright.""Overall, It Ends with Us (2024) is a boring attempt at doing a slow-paced romantic drama and it's one of the worst movies of 2024.",0.5
ajsciandra,"Everything about this film was stunning. Wonderful acting performances, writing, set design and wardrobe, This film was just stunning to watch - beautiful people in beautiful places. But the story is what makes this film so compelling. Such a strong message. Rising above and ending a pattern of domestic violence skillfully delivered. The characters were so well developed. It's amazing that such an incredible film could be made in a reportedly toxic production environment. Perhaps that off screen drama added to the actors performances. All in, this was a masterful collaboration of artists on point.",4.5
daveroseman-35849,"Lily (Blake Lively), decides to move to Boston and open up a flower shop and ends up meeting and falling in love with a neurosurgeon named Ryal (Justin Baldoni) but Ryal has a dark side which triggers memories of Lily's past. The film is Directed by Ryal/Justin. Written by Christy Hall and Colleen Hoover. This film also stars Jenny Slate (Allysa), Hassan Minhaj (Marshall), Brandon Sklenar (Atlas), Amy Morton (Jenny), Kevin McKidd (Andrew), Alex Neustaedter (young Atlas), and Isabela Ferrer (young Lily). The cast give a strong performance, but it's Blake Lively's perfromance that shines and is Oscar worthy in my opinion. Blake made me feel her pain and root for her fight as she struggles with decisions in her life. Just when you think you have the direction the film is headed their is a turn or twist. I really enjoyed this film and deserves your attention.",3.5
steiner-sam,"It's a romantic drama about abuse in the 2020s with flashbacks to the 2000s in Plethora, Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of Lily Bloom (Isabela Ferrer/Blake Lively), who, early in the film, indicates she has issues with her deceased abusive father (Kevin McKidd) and non-assertive mother (Amy Morton). She's moved to Boston and works hard to open a flower shop. She meets an attractive neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni), and discovers he's the brother of a woman, Allysa (Jenny Slate), who she's hired to work in the store. Ryle's assertive pursuit finally succeeds, and they become partners.Flashbacks to Lily's high school days introduce us to Atlas Corrigan (Alex Neustaedter/Brandon Sklenar), an unhoused boy she is drawn to and becomes her first love. Suddenly, one evening, when Ryle and Lily go out to dinner in a new restaurant, Lily reencounters Atlas as he's working there.Several incidents raise flags about Ryle, and Atlas also seems to have renewed interest in Lily. ""It Ends with Us"" delivers a clear message about abuse within marriage, even if there are extenuating circumstances.""It Ends with Us"" is a bit obvious, and Ryle becomes creepy long before Lily recognizes it. The older Alex seems unrelated to the younger Alex. The younger Lily seems more clued in than the older Lily.",3

Moreover, of course, she is so gorgeous and sexy in her unique beauty, fancy clothes, jewelries and shoes.Justin also acted so convincingly.

sneakyuk-49093,"I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, other than it's based on a bestselling novel, so I tried to keep an open mind.But after sitting through it, I'm still clueless about what this movie was even supposed to be about. There's this odd flower lady with obvious PTSD and major depression, who ends up dating a guy with his own set of issues, and then her high school boyfriend-who's also a mess-shows up. Even that summary makes it sound more interesting than it is. The truth is, the characters are one-dimensional, completely unrelatable, and their actions are baffling. Honestly, there's no point in worrying about spoilers because there's nothing of value to spoil.",0.5
movieman6-413-929510,"It Ends with Us is a new romantic drama directed by Justin Baldoni, director of Five Feet Apart. He also plays a role in this film. The film is further inspired by the novel of the same name by Colleen Hoover.Lily Bloom (Blake Lively) gets the chance to live her dreams after a traumatic childhood by opening her own flower shop. Here she meets neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni), with whom she manages to make a good connection. The two start a relationship with each other, but during this relationship Lily gets to know Ryle in a different way that reminds her of her childhood trauma.When Lily starts to calm down a bit, she meets Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar), with whom she also had a relationship when she was younger. After the events with Ryle, her old feelings for Atlas seem to come back, but this can only lead to more conflict.Fans of the book were not happy with the casting of the actors in this film and the further adjustments that writer Colleen Hoover made when adapting the film script. In the book, the characters are younger than the characters and actors in the film.After doing research later, she did not know, for example, that a neurosurgeon of the young age that she had given Ryle in her book was actually not possible, or realistic. That is why she had the characters made older for the film. In order to keep the love story realistic and acceptable, they also made Lilly's character older. Lily's passion and ideas are no longer as believable for someone her age.Colleen Hoover should have actually gone through these details earlier when she was working on her book. She could have kept them more realistic. The fans of her book are therefore more of the age that the characters in the book are. Due to the change in ages, some readers may find themselves less familiar with the characters in the film, because they now have a greater age difference than those of the book readers. Other details of the story also work a bit less believable, because you would expect different reactions and actions from the older characters, than how the characters written in the book react in the film. The older characters now also have more conversations and actions with each other, which are written more for younger characters.Despite the fact that the ages do not always exactly match the characters from the book, the cast members still manage to portray their roles quite well. Only during some events it does not work, because these are more events that older people would not recognize themselves in. If younger characters had conversations like in this film, it could still have been cute, but now that older characters have such conversations, it comes across as more strange.",2
strangejacob91,"Only rated a 10 because it deserves better than a 6.9. I'm typically not a fan of these types of movies, but I was a fan of how this one was done. Cinematically, storytelling, and score were done well. I didn't know anything about going in. My wife didn't want to watch it alone so I went with her. I almost brought my headphones just in case I got bored. There were quite a few ""wow I can't believe that happened moments."" The cutting back and forth was done really well and they did a good job taking you along with the main character. I honestly had no idea who she would end up with and I like that they didn't make the guy just a pure villain. Usually everyone that messes up has a story even if ultimately inexcusable. Its possible I liked it because I knew nothing going in, but I think this movie still deserves at least a 7.8.",5

anastazjamichalak,"I haven't read the book, I went to the cinema thinking it will be a romantic movie about true love. In the middle of the movie I started guessing that maybe Lilly will leave her husband for her one true love from her childhood or that one of them will die, or maybe she will need to choose between which one was best for her. And then BOOM! I was totally surprised when the movie touched such a difficult topic as violence and evolved in a completely new direction. Movie quality was good in my opinion, acting was good and Blake was amazing, I really like her genuine femininity, the way she speaks and shows emotions .",4
eileeenie,"I read this book two years ago. I enjoyed the movie so much. I think they did the books justice. Do not be discouraged from the clips of them filming with the outfits. It makes perfect sense and didn't feel like it took away from those that read the book. They casted the characters so well I am not mad one bit. I cried a few times throughout the movie... and was pleasantly surprised to have laughed out loud more. Definitely worth the watch.From those that didn't read it, I would guess you would think the movie is slow start, the dramatics maybe didn't hit hard as much as those that read it. My opinion only though.",4
pakhikrishna,"After reading the book, I didn't have much expectation from the movie because I thought it won't be that great but well it was really good. Personally every character played beautifully their part and the movie did justice to the story. It was overwhelming, good, giddy and romantic. Healed a huge amount of grief. Could be watched again for sure. The acting done by Justin and Blake was really good. One could see the pain and grief among the characters. It could have been better if was a short series with like 8 episodes. Atlas character was also pretty good considering how his role is presented in the book. The casting was great and the movie is a must watch.",4
SAMISAR,"First of all this was a great book with a moving story but it was not captivated in the movie at all. Blake Lively did not portay Lily Bloom like she is in the book at all.The way she has been trying to promote and turn this movie in to a romantic chick flic when it's about serious topics, abuse and trauma is beyond me. Several people were triggered at certain points in the movie because Blake promotes as a film for a romantic movie night.The producing and writing takes so much away of the weight and needed importance of understanding abuse between partners. Key scenes were missing. This movie is important and should have been so much more.As said before Blake was the wrong choice for Lily 1. Because she is unable to capture Lily's true essence and personality 2. Her acting is and has always been very basic with little range.Very disappointed with how this turned out.",0.5
eg91840,"I loved the movie, and I thought it was cast really well. I'm a huge Blake Lively fan, and I thought her execution was perfect. The storyline didn't feel rushed to me, it was really well done. The only thing I hated about this move was the ridiculous outfits. The costume design for Lilly was SUPER distracting. The horrible outfits pulled you out of the movie and ruined several scenes. I've never watched a movie and felt like costume design was so off until this movie. I guess I understand how important it is now. It kind of bummed me out. They missed the mark big time on costume design, but I still walked out impressed with the movie.",4
magesole,"I knew the movie dealt with abuse, what I didn't know was that the Romance the film-makers concentrate on would be With the Abuser and not with ""the other guy"". The visuals and the tone of the movie were too ""romantic"" for such serious topics. In my opinion, this movie wants to be too many things at once, hence fails at portraying anything.""It Ends With Us"" should have been introduced and promoted as a relationship drama with romance elements, the ""romance"" should have never been used as a selling point, which I must admit, I got caught in. I naively believed that the abusive relationship would take the backstage and we would concentrate on ""the other guy"", alas, my hopes were shattered pretty quickly. Most of the movie I had to clench my fists and growl in silence with the frustration of knowing that I am watching the relationship that leads nowhere and the relationship that should have never started.I personally have not been in an abusive relationship, but I can see, hear and determine the signs, and perhaps, in my age I am not the target demographic, but from the very first view and speech patterns Ryle used, I just wanted to punch him in the face. Also, I think Blake Lively portrayed Lily as too confident, to sell the idea that such a confident and financially independent woman would choose to be in a relationship with such an immature and needy man (and he was needy from the get-go).If this movie helps even just one person to leave this kind of relationship - great! However, filmmakers should have also considered the ones who have already left these relationships, and the movie should come with a trigger warning, because believe me, they do ""trigger"" (or annoy) even people without PTSD.",2.5

What more can I say.We need a sequel not a repeat in real life.Take heart. Take a friend. God bless and good night. Amen!",5
zgzfckzc,Blake Lively did a phenomenal work playing as Lily Bloom. Colleen Hoover was the right answer to join this project and create so much characters from her book to make it come to life. She casted Two Beautiful Men of Justin Baldoni and Brandon Skelenar playing both Ryle Kincaid and Atlas Corrigan both delivered such fierce and powerful performances in the film and the film was so good and Inspiring to women who suffer from domestic violence and leaves a message that there is hopped and you can break the pattern honestly I hope the major motion film wins An Academy Award or an Golden Globe for this film.,5
SAMTHEBESTEST,"It Ends With Us (2024) :
Movie Review -Based on Colleen Hoover's novel of the same name, It Ends With Us is a modern love triangle that goes out in vain due to the soulless gestures of two of the leading characters out of three. I'd still feel for one character who hasn't gotten over his first love, but I definitely have no feelings or empathy for the other two, who have literally left this film with no meaning. I didn't mind the sexual appeal and intimacy, and until the interval, that ""Casablanca"" touch was working fine. But tell me, who can make another Casablanca? Even Michael Curtiz himself would give up on making such a masterpiece love triangle again. Why do others try? I couldn't understand it to date. Many have used the formula and turned it into a big mess, and It Ends With Us is on the same lines, with an external feminist touch to it. Unfortunately, it fails to make an impact, and the long narrative is a tad slow most of the time.Lily Bloom (Blake Lively) has lost her father and meets a rich neurosurgeon, Ryle (Justin Baldoni), and their first conversation ends up with sexual advances that are left incomplete due to sudden circumstances. Why would they get so intimate in the first rough meeting? I couldn't gather. Lily and Ryle meet again as Ryle's sister, Allysa (Jenny Slate), is working at Lily's flower shop, and this time they begin dating. Despite warnings from Allysa, Lily falls in love with Ryle. The happy romance lives a short life as Lily sees her school-time boyfriend, Atlas (Brandon Sklenar), at a restaurant in the same town (Boston). We are taken to the flashback of young Lily and young Atlas' romance, and Atlas hasn't gotten over it yet. Has Lily really moved on? Will Ryle have no objections? There begins a mess!With a screenplay by Christy Hall, It Ends With Us has many funny moments and intimate scenes that do entertain you for a while, but don't mean anything to the main context in which the narrative unfolds later. What goes terribly wrong in the entire conclusion portion in the last 30 minutes when all three characters seem to have their senses and behave as if something big has happened, when in reality nothing big has happened. Making a mountain out of a molehill works for some films, but not here. I didn't mind the extreme use of feminism when Lily made some tough choices, but all I am asking is that the opposite didn't deserve such harsh treatment when you yourself were hiding something from him. The same applies to the severely misogynistic Ryle, who happens to be overly possessive against overly insecure Lily. Atlas is safe but too much in love with Lily. 8 years, and the man didn't move on? Really? What if he had never met her again? The plot and screenplay don't look logical with such basic mistakes, and it continues to hurt the film as well as our viewing experience till the end.Blake Lively looks hot and steamy-that was the plan, basically, since they did glamorize her with those glittering dresses, sexy attitude, and sultry scenes with Ryle. The chemistry with Justin Baldoni was fine, and it definitely arouses romantic interest in viewers. Justin losing his nerves in extremely important moments fails to convince you, which certainly makes the scenes look dull. Brandon Sklenar makes a pleasant entry but hasn't got any variety to showcase. Jenny Slate, as Jenny, is a total feminist that you can easily relate to. Amy Morton plays Lily's helpless and soulless mother with no extra effort, and Hasan Minhaj makes his small role look sweet with some party vibes.The film was beautifully shot by Barry Peterson, and the art design, costumes, and production design all looked very gorgeous. The problem appears in dialogues that don't have depth. ""The Naked Truth"" could have been used subtly, but they wasted it for two sex-friendly people's lusty conversation. It Ends With Us ends with two ladies, oh, sorry, three (I hope it is not a spoiler)-now you can guess how dragged it is, but still there are those ""coming-back,"" ""forgive-me,"" and ""back to first love"" cliches that bore you even more than the entire film has done until then. Director Justin Baldoni sees a film as a problematic romance or a complex romantic relationship, but he couldn't see that the conflicts used for it aren't really problematic. In simple terms, exam results wouldn't matter if your questions had no meaning. It Ends With Us ends up with no realization of this simple equation, but more than that, it's the vision and pace that take you away from the film.RATING - 4/10*",2
laurhartwick,"I read this book and found it problematic in some ways but some of the passages from the later half left a lasting impression so I do overall respect it.I found the movie, despite the changes they made with age, was a very good adaptation. The writers clearly put a lot of effort in keeping the key scenes as similar as possible and being mindful of what they edited out and how. They also kept the same message and tone of the book while making the adult characters older, and I ended up liking that a lot.I would give the book and this movie's plot a 6 or 7 but as a film I would rate it higher. Blake Lively was phenomenal and all the actors, the cinematography and soundtrack were very good. Above all it kept the somewhat odd mashup of a high income, beautiful people, beautiful world rom-com/chick-lit feel and a very serious topic which is not easy to do.",4
jesseniarafay,"The controversial themes of the movie were not an issue as they were glazed through and watered down heavily, the issue was that the controversy was hardly a plot for a story. At first I thought the movie had a slow start with some awkward character pairings but the slow start just never ended. I continued to wonder if the movie was actually about anything, it was as if the entire two hours was an intro that never ended. The story did not feel very real or emotion evoking. The side character romance felt more compelling than the main character romance. The main character from the past and present gave two completely different energies and personalities, one being more quaint and emphatic with moral purpose and the other more of a shy call girl who's lost her conviction somehow.",1.5
qbqnfh,"Let's be honest anything starring Blake lively is a great movie. She's so relatable. She's the girl next-door. She's able to light up the screen and to showcase the star she's acting with. She was really able to capture the vulnerability and the innocence that Lily had in the book. I didn't want the movie to end. There were certain parts that I was more emotional than others because I read the book and they did not. That's the beauty of reading a book, a movie will never be able to capture that. So you'll never be able to compare. I really enjoyed this movie I think it did the book a lot of justice. Colleen Hoover should be proud and I'm so happy that she ended up choosing Blake because like Colleen said once you see Blake playing Lily you can't see anyone else playing her.",5
karlevans-75682,So I stayed away from the book and didn't watch the trailer although I read something on the Internet purely by accident about glamourising domestic abuse.The subject matter is interlaced in a double love story with the ever radiant blake lively cast as the main character from Colleen hoovers book of the same name.I found myself totally immersed in a movie with a subject I've not come across before or maybe I side stepped them to avoid seeing the hurt these courageous souls put themselves through.Blake lively is utterly convincing as the lovely loved and then wronged lily bloom yep lily bloom you read it right unfortunately the rest of the cast can't hold a candle to her utterly mesmerising performance. I wouldn't say that domestic abuse was glamourised here I'd say it was done in a subtle way. Go see it and see for yourself!,4
lindakrokmo,"This movie was a roller-coaster. I read the book. And my my did they do good to make the movie close to the book and make it alive.The filmography was amazing, the casting was perfect and the scenes were perfect.For someone who hasn't read the book it was surprising, and they loved it.It had flashbacks, and how they've done them was like the book and it was just greatly done.The movie is a movie every woman (and man as well) should see. The movie without the message is a great watch, but the story is important.My hubby loved it just as much as me.Just to add a few more words. LOVED it.Get your popcorn (maybe tissues), get cosy and go watch it. It is worth it.If you read the book, RUN and watch it. Trust me. They did a good job.",4.5
alexandramariasofronie,"If you want to watch this movie, don't. Lively's acting was subpar at best, and I spent most of the movie looking at her hair (which she promotes her haircare brand for, which is frankly ridiculous) wondering if she had been electrocuted.Every outfit choice in this movie was certainly . . . Something. There were a few moments where I thought it could be redeemed, likely by the hand of Baldoni himself, but other than that the movie was generally boring, and, I felt, somewhat offensive. It's a book centered around domestic violence . . with domestic violence as the apparent 'plot twist', with no resources to help victims as shown at the end.Lively markets this film as if it's a romcom, but it should not be at all. The domestic violence is not marketed. It is insensitive, and honestly just an incredibly painful watch. This movie, overall, was terrible. I would not watch it again, especially with all the press controversy that it's been gaining.",0.5
curtispeace,"I just knew when I got here that this stupid movie would have some kind of high rating, because this is what people like?, what's wrong with you all?, do you need to have your heads examined?, I'm pretty sure you do, the first conversation between the girl and boy, on the roof, is so contrived and so impossibly nonsensical because nobody talks like this, nobody who meets each other has a conversation like this, only in a bad movie!, which reminds me, this movie is terrible, whatever might happen as it goes along, it can't overtake this first scene where I stopped, if you like this, I guess you like daytime soaps?, do yourself a favor if you have a brain that works, don't watch this pablum.",0.5
jvreagan-436-586816,"I cannot think of a worst flick I've seen in the past 40 years. Poor acting with the exception of a few of Blake Lively's solo scenes or shots. I hear this is supposed to be about an abusive relationship, but literally the movie doesn't not show that part until part of a ""reveal"" that in effect feels more like revisionist history than a true problem. There is no emotional build up creating empathy or anger or tension or literally any emotion. You're just wondering for 80% of the movie ""um, what is this movie about? A lady and her rough relationship with her mother?""Add in a non-existent plot - it's literally just random scenes with no logical connection - and all the supporting actors were beyond brutal, and you wind up with just a painful experience.I get this was based on a book, and maybe the book is the problem with so many unbelievable coincidences that you have to willfully suspend disbelief. I could not wait to get out of the theatre. I got the sense everyone else in the theatre was in the same boat.",0.5
jesswoods-97253,"I always worry when I see a movie based on a book I have read that it is going to be bad/ that it's going to cut out parts that I felt were essential or moving. That was not the case with this movie. I read the novel and was worried the movie wasn't going to be capture the feeling in Lily's shoes/ her mind. I think they did a great job, far better than I expected. It show cased the exact feeling of 'oh that's not him being violent', or it was 'just an accident' and brought back that it wasn't an accident in a skillful way. I watched it with friends and we all cried. The acting is great and you feel captivated in the story. I definitely think it's worth a watch whether you have seen the book or not.",5
snoli,"I was looking forward to this movie a lot, since I had read the book and found it nice, but I was very disappointed. The acting was very poor and, in my opinion, the actors were totally unfitting to their role. I found it very dull and boring and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Additionally, something that really bothered me was that there wasn't any message (like in the beginning or end) concerning domestic violence, how to reach help or any trigger warnings. Overall, I would say that the acting was bad, the story was boring (even though the book was ok) and the casting could be 100 times better.",1.5
Fatmadxb,"I'm writing this review, because all the very low ratings are obviously from people coming in with an agenda of being proud haters or got caught up with all the media frenzy.I read this book in 2020, there are a lot of cringe aspects to the book - but the messaging & storyline was unique & left a stamp. When I knew they'd make a movie I was excited. But, when they announced the cast - I was disappointed. They were nothing like I imagined. Nevertheless I ignored all the criticism and went to the movie with an open mind.The cast did a phenomenal job. Blake portrayed Lily wonderfully. Justin Baldoni created a Ryle I could never dream of, I was legit scared of him. He was so realistic - he did an insane job. Atlas was perfect. Young Atlas & Lily were adorable.The way this movie was directed and how the storyline was presented was perfect. I loved it and I shed so many tears. I also went with my friends one who read the book & hated it: she said she LOVED the movie and it exceeded her expectation. And my other friend didn't read the book, and loved the movie so much - shared with me that she doesn't understand all the hate.Overall - one of the BEST book adaptations I've ever watched. I could have easily watched 30 more minutes!",5
mddveares,"The book was unimpressive and I was unsure on what to expect when seeing It Ends with Us. Quickly realised how much better the movie was going to be.The artistry in the videography, fashion, locations/ sets was perfectly captured. The casting was fantastic, definitely when it came to Blake Lively and Isabella Ferrer. Strikingly similar, not only in appearance but speech and mannerisms.The essence of the book was captured perfectly, without being superfluous or boring. I also appreciate the subtly in the domestic violence scenes. Persuading viewers to see the violence through the eyes of the abuser and then rounding out the story to truely encapsulate what abuse is and how it should be viewed.Justin Baldoni = great actor, even better director.",4
r96sk,"I found 'It Ends with Us' to be largely great, though the way it ends does make me question how I feel about it.The performances of Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni (just me who thinks he looks a touch like Runar from 'Ice Age'? ...), Brandon Sklenar, Jenny Slate - heck, even Isabela Ferrer and Alex Neustaedter (iffy likeness aside) - are stellar. I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.Pace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.Amusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this. Upon exiting, visually I kinda felt like Will Smith in that famous 'The Pursuit of Happyness' (which I still haven't seen btw, gotta get on that) crowd scene - only surrounded by women. Bit awkward, I can't lie. ""Will watch anything!"" evidently leads me astray sometimes!",4
helenahandbasket-93734,"Because WOW did this suck mightily. I'd like both my money AND my time back.I've not been a fan of Colleen's writing so I guess I should have lowered my expectations- especially after learning Blake and Colleen are 'NOMG besties!!' and that Ryan was helping her rewrite scripts without bothering to mention the fact to the writer or director.Like the 'I thought you were a crypto bro!!' line, it's something that's so ungodly cringe and showcases how incredibly out of touch these people are with the real world machinations and how people normally interact with one another.The script itself was tedious and labored- like having a root canal without the pleasure of novocaine. The acting (by Lively especially) was just so forced and felt insincere, I'm not sure who thought McKidd was the guy for that role, but the casting director should have been fired for that alone. The main characters are meant to be portrayed as mid-20s, and instead we see someone pushing mid 40s? It makes absolutely no sense, and I (stupidly) thought that maybe this could salvage Colleen's novel, but alas, I may have just as well tossed a $50 into the fountain and made a wish- because neither of my thoughts would have a snowballs chance of coming close to expectations.Save your money, and maybe wait for it to be released on an app you already subscribe to, on a cold winter's night when you're bored to tears. At least this will help you fall asleep.",0.5
sinscopefilms,"It Ends With Us is a powerful adaptation that delivers a deeply emotional experience. From the moment the film starts, it captivates with a beautifully calming and ear-pleasing soundtrack. The music selection is spot-on making every scene with the perfect emotional tone.The cinematography is thoughtfully crafted, with slow-moving forward shots and handheld shaky shots that add to the film's intimacy and intensity. The chemistry between Lily and Ryle is palpable, and their interactions are enriched with great dialogue and humor. The love triangle at the center of the story is thought-provoking, showcasing the stark contrast between the two male protagonists - Ryle, the bad boy, and Atlas, the kind-hearted good guy. The tension that Ryle brings to the narrative is expertly executed, keeping the audience on edge.The cast is perfectly chosen, bringing authenticity and depth to their roles. The non-linear storytelling, enhanced by excellent parallel editing, adds layers to the narrative, making it all the more engaging. The story is fragmented, but this fragmentation mirrors the complexity of the relationships and emotions at play. Every dialogue feels genuine, and I found myself deeply empathetic toward the characters and their struggles.The third act of the film is intense, filled with tension that culminates in a plot twist that left me in awe. This film is a hard watch due to its exploration of complicated love and family dynamics, but it's also incredibly rewarding. It's a story that resonates deeply. Solid 9/10.",4.5
stevencsmovies,"Celebrity power couple Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are having a great summer. First Ryan had the release of DEADPOOL&WOLVERINE, which broke many records. Now it's Blake's turn, with the release of the romance movie IT ENDS WITH US. Based on the popular book of the same name written by Colleen Hoover, this is marketed as a ""love-triangle"" story. In reality however, it's about much more. Domestic abuse is unfortunately more common than people think, sometimes becoming generational. This movie takes a hard, unflinching look at this topic. It highlights the impossible choices one must make. Lily Bloom (Blake Lively) comes back home for her fathers' funeral. Staying there, she opens a flower shop with her new best friend Allysa (Jenny Slate). Allysa's brother Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni) stops by and is immediately obsessed with Lily. Later on, Lily's first flame Atlas (Brandon Sklenar) comes back into the picture. Saying I really enjoyed this film might sound strange, given the heavy subject matter, but that just means I think it's a well-made movie. Good acting, good writing, good story structure having flashbacks interspersed throughout. It definitely starts off feeling like a Hallmark movie with silly character names, but it gets better and better as it goes. Victims of abuse might find it hard to watch, but I think audiences have been waiting for a slightly more realistic perspective on romance, love, and relationships, and this is it.",4
dawnlwerner,"This movie has got so much negative press due to Blake Lively's attitude toward its seriousness during interviews.Although I only read the book due to the tens of thousands of rave reviews, I didn't find it at all that compelling given that Hoover discloses she started out her childhood in an abusive home. Citing her father throwing a tv at her mother and knocking her down in doing so. Given that level of trama albeit she was only 2-3 years old, her mother left him shortly after, I feel that level of trauma and seriousness wasn't portrayed as well as I would've thought.Going into the book I had no idea what it was about but like many of her books, from my understanding (at least recently) they all have themes of abuse and love, in a twisted, even romanticized sort of way. Albeit I was totally disgusted throughout by Ryle and more so her father the movie didn't portray the same power as the book and feel Blake had a lot to do with that. I'm not convinced she wanted to actually be associated with a domestic violence film but rather a glitzed out, glamorized best seller where I marry a neurosurgeon and discover he's not that great. I mean if they could create monster ball and win awards for the powerful content portrayed then I think they could've done a little better actually focusing on the violence part of this film. Whether it was verbal and more psychological over the physical. In the book we know how some of the scenes unfold however in the movie they are diminished, completely eliminated or blacked out before they even actually happen.There's no real build up to the events. There's no psychotic aspects - him going through her things after they move in together - and drinking to prepare for what he's going to do to her when she gets home, which results in the final case of his aggressiveness towards Lily. Rather the film actually downplays the event and reason on why she convinces herself to leave. It almost plays into the reason why women are accused of committing fake rape accounts. She actually ends up going to the hospital for no particular reason until you find out he at some point actually bit her. However the book invokes a final powerful act that convinces her to seriously consider leaving once and for all.The one thing I felt unnecessary to the book is what I felt to be an obvious Ellen acknowledge me shout out...
Given the content of the book and how informed we are on so many real women experiences I feel like this film could've have brought more justice and awareness... to why it's hard for women to leave and to what some of them actually face.But I feel like Blake wanted to have that whole florals and girlfriends vibe on a Friday afternoon. It was overly glamorized, poorly acted out and when it came to following the book scripted the less effective parts of the storyline. IE hot rich guy, the father looked like any father who might punch a guy in that face if he found him in his daughter room and the initial oven scene that just sort of flashed and legitimately looked like a joke.",1.5
e_santos-18803,"Most of the population watches movies, they don't read books. They missed an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into a much-needed topic. Boring movie. I love movies, but I don't remember ever looking at my watch during the movie like I did this time. I haven't read the book, but the movie is very superficial. Justin and Jenny are fantastic, excellent actors and that's what saves the movie. The main actress is not bad, but her performance is so romanticized that it's boring. It's the first time I've watched something with these actors. Domestic violence is terrible and it's not easy to get out of that cycle. Now I'll read the book, because I imagine it's more impactful.",2
vfayres,"I read the book because of all the hype. It was fine, it addressed the topic of DV in a sensitive and realistic fashion but the story itself felt a bit laboured. The film did a wonderful job of giving us just enough background to understand the journey. The fact that they aged up the characters also added realism to the stages of life they were in.Blake Lively did a fantastic job of portraying how easy it is to make excuses for people and the challenges around marital assault.I wish we'd had slightly more of the relationship with her mother as the generational growth is key to the story but otherwise a really heartfelt film.",4
taylordemski,That exceeded my expectations completely. Blake's quirky fits as Lily Bloom actually worked so well in the context of the film. The needle drops were perfectly executed. With the heavy subject matter you can tell this was made with a lot of sensitivity and intention to how things were depicted on screen. Great direction by Justin. I think book readers and those who haven't read will appreciate this adaptation. I did want more of Brandon Sklenar as Atlas. He was perfect!!! I really hope they make a sequel so we can see Lily and Atlas thrive and get their happy ending. I loved both books and would love to see it adapted as well.,4
gsv-93873,"Despite her mother's plea, Lily's bitter humanity can't summon even just one kind remark at a family funeral. She first meets her future abuser as his uncontrollable temper violently kicks over furniture. That red flag is too subtle, for it's love at first sight.The novel's 23 year-old Lily might've been oblivious to the story's multiple and obvious forebodings, but the movie's thirtysomething Lily stumbles over ""stupid is as stupid does"".The movie presents as an extended episode of Friends. Characters are soap opera gorgeous and privileged; glossy. There's no chemistry between the couples, nor family bonds. And the dialogue is spiked with one-liners from Ryan Reynold's Big Book of Corny Clichés. Not nearly enough heart, all around.",1
madimorgan-87171,"The depiction of how a relationship can slowly develop into one of abuse was done incredibly well. It had me feeling all the emotions right along side the characters, and the building sense of dread had me on the edge of my seat. I laughed, I cried, and I thought about it for days after seeing it. Of course it differed slightly from the book, but the overall emotions and message came through. My husband (who hasn't ready the book) enjoyed the movie, but did felt the story was rushed a bit, and was missing some of the in-depth relationship building I got from the books. Overall, I would recommend giving it a watch. At a minimum it's thought provoking, and sheds light on some of the realities many women face in our society.",4.5
jasperjiajie,"A fascinating and moving story. Blake Lively is the perfect actor for Lily's character. It Ends With Us delivers a profound and powerful message: we need not let anything but ourselves define us. This film invokes laughter, sorrow, pain, anger, love, and joy with moments that feel genuine and heartfelt. The soundtrack fits each moment perfectly, and the story, although at times a little removed from reality, is overall sound. It Ends With Us is among select great films that change the audience; we grow and are moved as we journey with Lily. A must-watch for any one who loves, is loved, and/or wants (to) love.",4.5
donmurray29,"Giving this an 8/10 ratingThe only thing wrong with this film is that it's a bit long, shave of about 10 minutes, but that is a slim comment on an otherwise very compelling film, that really is about mental health as the domestic abuse story.Blake Lively,Justin Baldoni and Jenny Slate are just really superb they steal the show, but the rest of the cast are just as good, I don't' know anything about the book itself, but the screen story is a good watch and eats up the time in a good way, I had no problem with it, Justin Baldoni's direction is good and the background landscape is lovely to gaze at, and with the soundtrack the does suit the action, it's not in your face.So what you get is a different movie subject for a change, and it's done very well, the violence is very brief and used lightly, not all over the place, as the film progresses. It deserves the high rating it has and the showing I attended was a full house.",4
linaeltabib,"I give this movie 4 stars, largely for the stunning cinematography. Visually, it's a beautifully shot film with excellent set design that, along with the strong performances from the cast, does its best to elevate the material.However, the story and dialogue leave much to be desired. The plot feels like it was written by 12 year old in wattpad, struggling to tackle serious issues like abusive relationships and toxic dynamics. The dialogue is often childish, and the scenes suffer from random time skips that disrupt the narrative flow.As the saying goes, good cinematography and a strong soundtrack can sometimes make up for a weak plot, and that's somewhat true here. The crew's effort to create a visually appealing film is commendable, and the actors did their best with what they were given.I've never read any of Colleen Hoover's books, but based on this adaptation, the characters don't seem well-developed. The main male lead is particularly hard to connect with, and his relationship with the female protagonist feels random and unconvincing. The secondary male character made more sense and was easier to understand.Overall, while the film falls short in many areas, I respect the crew for their hard work in trying to make it as good as possible.",2
MovieswDan,"Earlier last week my wife and I went to see the new drama, It Ends with Us, directed by Justin Baldoni and starring Blake Lively. The film centers around Lily Bloom (Lively) as she learns to cope with the abusive men in her life.I knew that this movie was going to have a great story solely because it is based on the book by Colleen Hoover. This movie was very well done, and I was impressed by the great chemistry between Lively and Baldoni, who not only directed the film but starred in it as well. What is even more impressive is seeing their chemistry knowing about all of the drama that has been going on off set. As pretty much everyone is by now aware, Baldoni and Lively do not get along and I am sure it made for some awkwardness on set, but you would never have guessed that based on both of their performances. What stood out most for me and what made me believe that this is truly a great movie that everyone should see was the way that screenwriter Christy Hall brought this story to life. In most movies that we see where these is a tone of abuse, it is very one-sided, and the abuser is seen as a monster rather than a human. What this movie did so well was showing us both sides while still making it clear that abuse of any kind is never excusable and should never be tolerated.I really loved this movie and feel that it tells such an important story in an absolutely beautiful way. This is the kind of movie that every guy needs to watch. I of course am not saying that only men abuse people, but the statistics show that 1 in 7 men experience some form of physical abuse in their lifetimes vs. 1 in 4 women.",4
Entertainmentsparadise,"I walked into It Ends with Us with no expectations-no knowledge of the book, and not even a glance at the trailer. What I anticipated to be a straightforward romance unraveled into a story woven with drama, abuse, love, lust, and every emotion in between. This film, though seemingly aimed at a female audience with its abundance of romantic lines, is much more than a mere love story; it's a deep dive into the complexities of toxic abusive relationships which can stem from childhood trauma.The movie is filled with witty and romantic banter that's sure to make hearts flutter, but it also has the potential to trigger those who have faced the darker sides of love. With a leading man who looks like he stepped right out of Grey's Anatomy-tall, dark, and handsome, though more stereotypical than distinctive-the film feels like a whirlwind of red flags. It's true what they say: when you're in lust, love, or something in between, it's easy to ignore the warning signs.Despite its heavy dialogue, the film flows seamlessly, carrying the audience through dramatic scenes and emotional highs and lows. There were moments that had me on the edge of my seat, with unexpected twists and flashbacks adding depth to the narrative. While some might find it predictable, the emotional intensity kept me engaged, and I found myself deeply invested in the fate of our protagonist, Lily Blossom Bloom.As Lily navigates her way out of a toxic relationship, the film's true message hits hard, revealing the painful reality that love can often be entwined with abuse. The emotional rollercoaster is heightened by the realization that the man she loved for years never moved on, waiting for her for two decades-a bittersweet reminder of the old adage that nice guys finish last.In the end, It Ends with Us is not just a romance, but a poignant exploration of the complexities of love and the resilience it takes to overcome its darker aspects. It's a movie worth watching, especially for women, but men should take note-this is a film that could spark meaningful conversations about relationships. I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10, a four-star recommendation for anyone ready to dive into a story that's as dramatic as it is romantic.",4
ghostreview,"The movie ""It Ends with Us"" attempts to address a significant issue but ultimately reduces it to the backdrop of a superficial love story. In contrast, Tyler Perry's films, often criticized for their comedic, gender-bending roles, surprisingly offer a more nuanced portrayal of similar issues. The argument that one must read the book to appreciate the movie's depth falls flat, as many successful adaptations, such as ""A walk to remember"", ""The Notebook"", and ""Gone Girl"", manage to stand on their own. These films effectively translate unique narratives from page to screen without requiring prior knowledge of the source material. By failing to do the same, ""It Ends with Us"" misses the mark, relying too heavily on its literary origin instead of crafting a compelling standalone film.",2
dvjrpygj,"I didn't read the book. The movie is super slow. Sat thought the movie waiting to feel something but nothing. I don't understand what the buzz is about.

glenngoddard-12174,"I don't enjoy pretending to be a movie critic. I don't know the intricacy of camera angles, etc, etc.So this rating is just how I felt watching it.

Incredibly thought provoking and it shines a very important light on how abuse can come from anywhere and in many different forms.I don't want to spoil anything but I'd love for you to think about what you think of each character at the end.I also wish we could see Blake lively in more movies. She absolutely captures the screen and you can't help but feel what she feels.I may well steal the name atlas for my future child hahaGreat film.",4.5
marirjones,"The movie had a good message, I guess, but Blake's acting has seen better days. She made weird faces the whole time it distracted from everything. Having Owen play an abuser is crazy. You can tell Ryan allowed her to ruin this movie using his Hollywood power to let her have her way. I didn't read the book, my daughter did. I read the synopsis. Do people not believe in therapy? Ryle had SEVERE trauma. My biggest issue with the story was the SA. Was that in the book what even happened? In the book was Lily Bloom a complete moron at communication also? Since when do women not defend themselves? This movie might have been a decent book, but Blake Lively ruined the charcater and translation of it, honestly.",0.5
zmejp,Ok so I didn't hate the film but I could not stomach Blake. The fact that she and her husband had any say in this movie is mind boggling. Like why? Don't get me started on the clothes! It was distraction to say the least. I really wish they pick a real actress for this role. It was very disappointing. The rest of the actors did a wonderful job. I wish the promotions talked more about domestic violence more. Instead of Blake's hair care line and her flower dresses. If you read the book you would know it wasn't about flowers as much as the struggles between loving someone but knowing you can't be with them.,1.5
rgandrade2000,"This film delivers a gripping portrayal of domestic violence, presenting both sides of the story and making the lead character's inner conflict feel real and relatable. It's almost as if you've walked the same path as the lead character, experiencing the emotional damage along the way and connecting deeply with the film.The connections built throughout the film offer much to reflect on, with the plot tying together nicely by the end. It avoids a clichéd dramatic finale, and while a few moments were predictable, most of the story unfolded naturally. Additionally, Allysa's performance was a highlight-full of energy and a joy to watch. On the other hand, Atlas fell flat, with stilted dialogue that didn't quite land. Ryle was solid, and the rest of the cast was decent.Despite these strengths, the film is not without its flaws. Some characters felt too conveniently placed, almost forced into the storyline, though their relationships developed well as the story progressed.In summary, this is a powerful film with a compelling plot that prompts deep reflection on life. It leaves you with a mixture of strange reality and foggy thoughts about your own life and decisions. This is exactly the kind of emotional impact I seek, and the film achieved it. Definitely recommended.",4.5
andrewsage-58714,"SPOILER FREE REVIEWIt Ends With Us is a romance/drama starring the much beloved Blake Lively. But boy, oh boy, this film is a doozy. Strap in folks.It Ends With Us is a movie about abusive relationships. Now, as someone who despises Colleen Hoover's writing, I can say that the book is significantly worse than the movie. Her writing is FULL of themes and subjects that are immoral and unhealthy. But the movie, although better, is not MUCH better.As stated before, this is a movie about domestic abuse, and frankly, that's not entertainment. It is an important topic, which should be discussed to EVERYONE to help them understand a proper, healthy relationship, but why would anyone see this? Because it's romantic? It's not. Because it has good plot and scenes? It doesn't.The only commendable thing I can say about this film (if you could even call it that) is Blake Lively's acting. I've always loved Blake Lively, she does well in the roles she chooses (for example, A Simple Favor is a great flick, which I would highly recommend over this one), but Lord, could she have chosen a more awful movie?Colleen Hoover's books should never, I repeat, NEVER be made into movies. It's not romance! This isn't even a good portrayal of romance! This entire movie is about trauma! And might I remind you, the author wrote this not to send a message about abuse, but she wrote it just because she could! Again I say, this is not romance. I would spend $7 on a ticket for another film. ANY other film.The only reason this author is famous is because she writes ""spicy"" scenes. I wouldn't advise you to support her, or her movie. You won't be disappointed with doing so, whereas if you do go see this, I guarantee you will cringe, shrink back, if not cry, for all the wrong reasons.",0.5
crystalgeyser-18690,"I came into this movie not knowing anything about it. The only thing I was aware of was that it is a bestselling novel... so I was totally open minded.After watching it, I still have no clue what this movie is about. There is this weird flower lady, who clearly has some ptsd and massive depression issues and she starts dating this guy, who also has issues, but then her high school boyfriend shows up and he has issues as well.... Blah blah blah. But I'm making it seem more interesting and deep than it really is. The thing is, none of the characters are that deep or relatable in any way, and I never understood the motivations of their actions. I don't wanna give up any spoilers, though there's nothing really to spoil here. If you've ever seen a Lifetime movie or a Tyler Perry flick, you'll pick up on the cliche themes right away.Ne thing I'll say though, Blake Lively is usually a decent actress, but she's quite obnoxious in this. She's been with Ryan Reynolds for so long, now they even have the same acting style and inflection. Deadpool ends with us lol.Skip this one unless you're 16 or IQ 70.",1.5

It's been awhile since I read the Colleen Hoover book, but everything came rushing back with this movie.I missed all of Lily's Ellen Show memories/stories, but I think the story flowed without it. I also thought the choice of the younger actors were spot on - so glad they didn't try and make Blake Lively appear as if she was 17 again. I never would have believed it!I hope this writing team try's to adapt another novel. They did a solid job translating the book to screen.",4
emilyvmincey,"This movie has less chemistry than Flowers in the Attic, and less tension than an episode of Sesame Street.Blake was always the wrong choice for this character, since Lily is supposed to be in her early 20's, so the willful ignorance of the world around her believable. Young Lily should have been the main actress. She looked and acted the part very well, in deep contrast to Blake's acting, which felt as ""lively"" as a funeral.Justin was one of the better actors of the movie, but it did feel like he too was phoning it in. The actor playing Atlas was okay, but I'd watch 40 minutes of him again before any of the others playing modern day characters.TLDR: just as in the book, only Alyssa and Marshall are worth paying attention to.",1.5
dishamatta,"""It Ends With Us"" is a captivating adaptation of a book written by Colleen Hoover, that combines romance with the serious issue of domestic violence. Directed by Justin Baldoni, the film tells the story of Lily Bloom, portrayed by Blake Lively (My favorite gossip girl), who has experienced domestic violence in her past and is striving to build a new life in the city by starting her own flower shop. The movie initially presents itself as a lighthearted romantic drama but takes a serious turn as it addresses the topic of domestic violence.The film's storyline holds surprises, especially the first encounter between Lily and Ryle on the terrace, which happens to be a favourite moment for many viewers. ""It Ends With Us"" also encourages discussion about toxic masculinity and the difficult choices individuals face in breaking generational patterns for the well-being of future generations.While the movie received overall positive feedback, some critics pointed out that Blake Lively's portrayal of Lily lacked the necessary intensity for the role. Additionally, some viewers were not fond of her character's wardrobe choices. However, Justin and Brandon's performances received praise for their compelling portrayals.Overall, ""It Ends With Us"" serves as a thought-provoking film that highlights the complexities of love and the challenges posed by toxic generational patterns.",4
Movielover0907,"There are many many authors and books out there. Colleen Hoover is problematic in general, but in terms of her writing, it is juvenile and she writes to please a general audience and has no real voice. The drama surrounding this movie has been off putting as well as the director and co star's creative vision seems to have been rejected in favor of the actor's vision. I have always loved Blake Lively, but this movie has not done her reputation any favors. I wish we can see the director's version one day. The movie wasn't as good as the book which looking back, while I enjoyed it, I don't see the need for it to have been turned into a movie. Side note: same with another of Blake's movie, A Simple Favor. That book was actually really bad and I'm losing confidence about Blake's ability to make decisions on movies to be in.",0.5
piupauz,"I read the novel and relived my own nightmares while reading the novel but in a closure kind of way. A lot of important details were left from the book. A lot of details that so many women live through. The second guessing of oneself, the gaslighting, the love bombing, the promises, the fear of losing everything, the shame and many more. The violence was downplayed by a lot. There was no emotion in the female leads eyes. You could see that she just don't get it. I just could'nt connect with Blake in this movie. A better actress would have been preferred. Someone who really can act. Not just a pretty face. Isabela Ferrer did amazing job as young Lily Bloom and I think she would have even better in the lead.",2
christinazelger,"I read the book, and that was already an abomination of literature, but the movie managed to make it worse.The book reads as if a lovesick, thirteen year old girl wrote it. It's plain, forgettable wattpad material with forced and unnatural dialogue. Every single scene, plot, and character is the incarnation of a cliché.Now, the film. Aside from weird and scattered pacing, the cuts (especially in intense scenes) leave you wondering what just happened, there's some unnecessary blur and slow motion going on, too. It leaves out parts of the book or skews the timeline a bit, which I understand is necessary, but badly done in this case. We also don't get a look inside Lily's head, she lacks depth and development just as much as every other character. Some information and backstory should have been mentioned earlier, to let the viewer understand. Overall it's flat and deals with the topic of domestic abuse miserably. The message should and could have been more intentional.I will not even begin to talk about the horrendous and problematic promotion work, let alone Hoover herself.So? Please keep book and film away from the youth.",0.5
burtjee,"It saddens me to see how this movie emotionally manipulates the viewer towards the conclusion of 'it ends with us'.No one can condone the actions of the co-lead. However, making PTSD/mental health a cross and stigma that he has to carry and bear the brunt of; rather than showing how he could have been given help (his parents send him to med school, but not a shrink!) is extremely disappointing.And for sure he didn't wake up 30 years later exhibiting such behavior, where was his preachy sister then?This movie should have ended with a positive and human supporting human climax fitting of 'IT STARTS WITH US.'",0.5
anikajchoudhury,"I do not like the movie adaptation at all. It did skip a lot of beautiful , meaningful moments, which makes the book desirable to read. I do not think this movie did any justice to the book.there are lot of things, they skip the part. The movie was mostly focused on black Lively, not to the other characters. They do have their own sides of story to tell. Also, I think black lively could bring more emotions to playing lily bloom. But, It's worthy to mention that anyone would be emotionally affected by this movie. Overall,it will at least start the conversion of social issue which is domestic abuse.",1.5
esthermusembi,"The book in itself was poorly portrayed in the movie. I feel like from the get go the actors chosen, the script that was played out it was just not what I expected. Before the online backlash even began, clearly everyone had a certain picture they had created when they read the book. Now obviously colleen couldn't take in all those suggestions but still very odd choices were placed and the audience had to run with it. For example , lily. With no hatred to the actress, that was absolutely nothing close to how anyone pictured her. Shiii I couldn't even imagine. It's so odd because lily had been portrayed as a young woman but anywaysss.",1
mahay-51479,"The whole movie was cringe, from the choice of charecter roles, how they looked, the lines said was very cliche and cringe, sort of up in your face with no filters. There were times where I laughed at how cringe the scenes looked or what they said.The pace of the movie was off, first meeting that toxic charecter was slow and uninteresting but then the charecter that really mattered was rushed and I felt no connection between them.I thought I'd see a different kind of storyline but it felt like it was written by a high schooler, just everything gave highscool dating vibes and not grown up romance or love.I wouldn't pay to watch it.",2
larisabuz,"In the beginning of the movie I thought I will have to give it 1/10. But somehow it got better in time. Although, some of the scenes are lacking some depth. Like, can't you think of writing something more than ""same"" as a reply to someone? There were some scenes that were alright, like the friendship between Lily and Allyssa about how Lily should leave Ryle. And the scenes between Lily and Ryle as teenagers. But that's it. I really think the movie did better than the book, which doesn't happen often. The writing is straight up bad. I understand that they promoted it as a rom-com rather than a movie about DC (domestic violence). They should've focused more on that.",2.5
moviemanmo973,"Disclaimer: I've never read the book so my review is not about how good of an adaptation it is.I knew this was based on a novel and had only seen the trailer. The trailer was pretty generic and that's what I expected this to be. And for the most part I was right about my assumptions. A woman falls in love with a man but soon realizes she loves her ex after he comes back into her life.What I did not expect was the emphasis of domestic violence in this story. Unfortunately, this film treads too lightly and takes too long in revealing that it's dealing with this major topic.The scenes of domestic violence were shown as accidents for most of the film so it wasn't apparent that these things were happening. I understand it was done intentionally to show how victims of such abuse are often in denial and repress their memories. However, I would have preferred if it was more straight forward with its intentions. Its message would have been stronger and much clearer had the scenes of abuse not been downplayed just to cater to a younger audience. I think it's important for young women to receive these lessons but minimizing these harsh realities is not the most effective way to make an impact.As far as characters are concerned, Atlas was the most grounded. I felt more sympathy for him throughout the film than I ever did for Lily at any moment. The film did a better job at making him feel vulnerable with the effective flashbacks and backstory. And his relationship and chemistry both as a teenager and an adult was much more believable than Lily's relationship with Ryle.Overall, the best parts of the film were the parts that dealt strictly with Atlas and Lily. Had this film not been adapted from a best-selling novel it would have never been in theaters. This is not worth the money just wait to stream it.",2
lucyjackson-13403,"I had high hopes for this film. Yes I'm a book reader and I love this book, but I can separate the two to appreciate a film. I understand not everything can go into a film and not everything from a book translates well on screen. That being said, I think that some of the most important scenes that really tell the story were cut that should not have been. Lily talking to her mother about Ryle abusing her and her mum opening up about her experience with Lily's father, was such an important and emotional part of the book and cutting this was a mistake in my opinion.The film feels like 'they played it safe'. The domestic violence scenes are too watered down and the emotion just doesn't hit like it did in the book. The backstory with Atlas felt so rushed and didn't convey the depth to their relationship. I viewed this at the cinema with someone who hasn't read the book and they had so many questions, because in their words they felt the movie was 'choppy'. The pacing was so slow at times then at other times felt rushed and it made me wish they'd done this as a show instead. With more time to tell the story and having people onboard, who wouldn't have been afraid to really deliver this message in a more powerful and non apologetic way really makes me mourn what this could have been!I will say that I thought Justin Baldoni acted really well in this and played Ryle very well. He did a great job at portraying someone who was charismatic and charming, but also someone who was ultimately abusive and didn't deserve Lily. The film itself was visually beautiful, such as shots of the city and both the restaurant and flower shop. But that doesn't make up for what this film truly could have been. I felt at times I was watching a made for tv movie and whilst this film delivers a great message to women, the film is too surface level to really hit your emotions. Do yourself a favour if you haven't already and read the book instead.",2
sanne-maria-jansson,"This movie could have been soooo good! Could have. If it wasnt for the horrible styling of the main character ... I rarely get hang-ups about this stuff, but there where moments in the movie where I had problems to engage in the ongoing drama because of that. It feels like someone older tried to dress the main character as they believe young people dress. Also it didnt really match the characters traits. I mean, big poodle-hair-thingy? High heels of all sorts. The bustiers??? And then cut to suspenders and patchwork-shirts. It was hella confusing! Disregarding the bad wardrobe-choices there where some good bits, but the really good stuff was rushed through to fast. The steamy bits felt ""meh"", and the hard bits was toned down to much. The best part of the movie? Every scene with Brandon Sklendar! And that is not only cause he looks soooo good, cause he does, but the acting was acting! So freaking good.",2.5
rwagss97,"While it makes sense to age up the characters based on mistakes made by Colleen Hoover, casting Blake Lively as Lily Bloom was an incredible fail. Blake's acting has always been mediocre at best, and this film was no different. I didn't feel a connection to her character and her performance unfortunately was shallow and simply fell flat. It's a shame, because there was a real opportunity for this film to be something special. I felt young Lily was brilliantly cast, and Justin Baldoni poured his soul into Ryle, which translated spectacularly across the screen. Overall, this isn't a movie I would watch again. Additionally, the music selections felt ill-selected and wrong for this movie. I'm not sure who selected the songs, but their choice definitely downgraded the movie from a mature piece to a seemingly teenage drama romance. Overall, I was impressed with young Lily & Justin Baldoni, who were both super, and I was incredibly disappointed and underwhelmed by Blake's performance.",2.5
sarah_bt93,"I normally love Blake but she was wrong to cast for this role. This role was not for her, she didn't play it well. I'm sorry to say but it should have been someone more serious and about 10 years younger. Potentially, Isabela Ferrer who played young Lily would have been a much better option. The outfits she wore were ridiculous, nobody would ever dress like that and definitely not somebody who is so into flowers. Blake usually has a great sense of style, I don't know how she was allowed to style herself and picked these outfits. They underplayed the domestic violence and its significance in the storyline. Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar were great. Filming, lighting, flower shop decoration were good.",2.5
cinemapersonified,"Rating: 4.2
Overall, a bad movie as the creative conflict between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni really seeps onto the screen because the movie does not know if it wants to be this cutesy rom-com or a serious drama about a serious topic; while the latter is somewhat executed well, the former is just so cringey and bad that the movie just feels like a larger budget Lifetime movie.Direction: Bad
The direction on a macroscale is incredibly poor for the most part, as while he does build the overlaying conflict well in the end, the movie is shrouded in a very bad romance and not great world-building; the creative differences between Baldoni and Lively are very evident on the screen, as the movie struggles to choose if it wants to be a light-hearted comedy or a serious movie about a serious topic; the direction on a microscale for the first hour and a half is very bad, as the romantic interpersonal scenes feel like a Hallmark movie with a bigger budget, but the final hour is pretty good, as it handles the overall sensitive subject well; storytelling is too simple and amateur for such an important subject that it really holds the movie back; they build tension very shallowly for the most part, but it is decent towards the endsStory: Very Bad
The concept is an important topic, it's just to movie does a poor job at building this because it shrouds the movie in this cringey, forced romantic-comedy, and while it does do a decent job handling the important subjects, it builds it up in such a simplistic way; the plot structure is alright as it gradually moves forward, while taking some flashbacks to provide backstory into the past, but it feels a little to simplsitic at times; character writing is too shallow for a movie of this magnitude as Lily Blossom Bloom and Ryle are so poorly written, especially with their cringey dialogueScreenplay: Very Bad
The dialogue is atrocious as it is so cringey that it becomes hard to watch at times; the humor is so forced that the movie becomes unintentionally funny; the symbolism is a little too shallow for a movie of this magnitude, but it does steer more in the positive direction; the foreshadowing is, but there are some moments that are carried out wellActing: Bad
Blake Lively: Bad (Her emotionless, effortless performance is very hard to watch as it feels like she isn't even trying to work with her castmates; while her performance towards the end is a bit more nuanced, I feel like any trained actor could do what she did; it is very evident the controversy between Baldoni and Lively seeped into filming as there is no on-screen chemistry between the two)
Justin Baldoni: Bad (Such a shallow, toneless performance that feels like something out of a Lifetime movie; His line delivery is incredibly cringey and hard to watch at times; It is very evident the controversy between Baldoni and Lively seeped into filming as there is no on-screen chemistry between the two)
Jenny Slate: Pretty Bad (She has some emotion throughout the movie, but it does not feel like it matches the rest of the cast; she still probably does her best to develop some ounce of chemistry with her castmates)
Hasan Minhaj: Very Bad (His slapstick, forced comedy really does work in this movie as it is very obvious he isn't reading the room, especially for a movie with a very serious topic)
Brandon Sklenar: Decent (The only person with a somewhat watchable performance is he, as he has some charisma and energy that is needed for the movie and his scenes)
Rest of the cast: Bad (It just feels like a Lifetime movie with a bigger budget)Score: DecentSoundtrack: Bad

It was very obvious Blake Lively wanted to show off her closet, as her wardrobe does not match her character or the scenes she is in at allPacing
Pacing is decent; it's just the poor writing makes the movie feel like it's moving slower than it actually isClimax
Climax is executed decently well; this is why the movie starts to hit its stride and actually get a bit more nuanced when talking about the subject; it's just it feels a little too lateTone
Tone is the biggest issue for this movie because it shows the strong creative conflict for this movie; the movie does not know if it wants to be this cutesy rom-com or a serious drama about a serious topic.",2

The male actors were somewhat better actually they were perfection their clothes their acting the portrayal of the role was just on point by Justin but Blake on the other hand she just ruined the whole movie and the direction oh my god the flashbacks were not even that well like it was jumping from the past to the present make a movie a little longer but please pay attention your story line.,0.5
nadasiaj,"Watching this movie felt like a chore. The acting was painfully wooden, with the cast delivering lines as if they were reading from cue cards for the first time. The actors seemed completely detached from their characters, lacking any chemistry or emotional depth. Every scene felt forced and lifeless, making it impossible to get invested in the story. It's clear that neither the script nor the cast had any passion for this project.

Like she lives in La La land .",0.5
justynshere,Blake lively is a weird one. She does okay but I have a hard time feeling bad for her character who she's trying her hardest (poor thang) to embody. Because underneath the character is a hateful and nasty human being. I would not suggest this movie to anyone who knows who she is for it'll be ruined for them. They should have gotten someone else to play the part because can her name sell tickets? Can her name sell the sympathy her character needs from the audience? No it can not and not it can not. I'd suggest watching good movies like... uh... Casper or.... Uh.... Maybe the 2000 made for tv movie homicide with detective much. Anything. Anything would be better.,0.5
seven-johnson,"Lily Bloom - a florist... seriously? I know some nations have less intellectual naming conventions, but the book this was based upon must have been written by a child. A not very bright child.Characters are two dimensional and unlikable, especially the incredibly bland Lily. This isn't helped by the woeful casting of Lively, some generic nepo-baby ""actress""/clothes horse from... Gossip Girl.I suspect there's some factory in California that clones kids and dumps them straight into the waiting arms of a nanny so the disenterested parents can focus on their vapid careers. It's like some Aryan wet dream.Try imagining this as a horror film, it's not hard, but you will be rooting for the villain.Honestly I was disappointed Kyle Kincaid (good name lol) didn't rampage through the rest of the cast with a claw hammer. It's just so insipid and drab you'll be longing for the days of ad breaks.There are far better ways to spend your time. No one involved with this film should work again.",0.5
katerinefarias,"I read the book right before I watch the movie, and I of course know that book adaptations are usually not as good as the books, which is somewhat understandable.

I feel they could've made this MUCH better, they could've made it so deep and focused on the DV cases, but they chose to just make it another cheesy romantic film.

Abusers don't let victims get away so easily and what about all the clichés of the world in a romantic -wanna be serious- movie. I mean even the ending.... Omg... I was furious for the most part of the movie... 3 stars only for direction and photography, those were enjoyable.

gkhpcqftq,"Watching ""It Ends With Us"" was a bit of a mixed experience. From the start, it was clear that the movie struggled with pacing and clarity, making it difficult to immerse yourself in the story. The film frequently jumped between modern and past settings, creating a sense of disorientation, especially during the first 15-20 minutes. If you weren't paying close attention, it was easy to lose track of what was happening. While I eventually caught on, the initial confusion took away from the overall experience.The performances also left something to be desired. Much of the acting felt scripted and unnatural, with several scenes coming across as unrealistic and hard to believe. That said, Brandon Sklenar's portrayal stood out as one of the stronger aspects of the film. He brought depth to his role, making his character one of the few that felt truly authentic.Despite its flaws, the movie did have some redeeming qualities. The plot itself is compelling, and the message at the heart of the story is important and relevant. The way the film handled themes of abuse and the plot twists were well-timed and impactful, adding some much-needed weight to the narrative. However, these moments were sometimes lost in the disjointed storytelling and uneven character development.Visually, the movie was appealing. The camera work was particularly impressive, enhancing the overall aesthetic and helping to tell the story in a way that was engaging to watch. It's just unfortunate that the visual appeal couldn't fully compensate for the other shortcomings.In the end, ""It Ends With Us"" has a strong foundation with its plot and message, but the execution falls short. The confusing narrative structure, scripted performances, and lack of realism in some scenes make it difficult to fully enjoy. While it's a film with good intentions, it ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to deliver something truly powerful.",2
carol_laidlaw,"When I say I could only sit through the first hour of this film at the cinema, that tells you whether I think it's worth watching or not. It has a promising start. The first part is about the main character, Lily, coming home for her father's funeral. She is expected to produce a eulogy for him but can find nothing to say so she walks out of the the service. This is relatable. Most of us know somebody so dislikeable that we can find nothing good to say about them. When that person is a relative it suggests they were abusive. But this start is not developed. There are a couple of small hints that Lily's father was indeed an abuser but she seems unaffected by it.The script is scrappy and amateurish. The dialogue is unreal in parts, which means you just don't believe in the characters. The characterisation is non-existent. When Lily meets a handsome surgeon who is taking his temper out on the furniture on the roof of his block of flats, he tells her he is upset because he lost one of his patients that day. This might or might not be a lie but the audience is unable to tell because his character simply isn't developed. He and Lily spend the next hour beaming at each other and pretending they don't want to get down to it; until they do. There's no depiction of a developing relationship.Lily's previous boyfriend from her home town features in a number of scenes but the script is so badly put together that it's hard to be sure that the story is switching between the past and the present until the film is about 40 minutes in. What's also confusing is that the actors in the past and present scenes look the same age. In the scenes where they are supposed to be at high school they look about 30.When, an hour into the film, Lily's past boyfriend shows up again and creates the potential for a love triangle, I simply wasn't interested enough to stay to find out what happened next. I'd conclude that this film isn't worth anybody's time. The storytelling is disjointed, the dialogue unconvincing, the .characters as thin as tissue paper and the whole thing is unengaging.",1.5
anders-080582,"IT ENDS WITH US**An over
hyped movie that turned out to be TRIVIAL and SHALLOW, to say the least, sometimes it almost felt as if I was watching Dawson's Creek ... the issue is dealt with in a superficial, predictable, often pathetic way, the dialogues are just as banal as the rest, it's almost sickening.Romanticized portrayal of a major issue, whereas many pivotal aspects of domestic violence are completely overlooked, the lead actress, as charming as an ingrown toenail, adds no depth whatsoever to the plot, besides her pleasant appearance.The actors lack charisma and true emotional depth. A product packaged for the sake of the aesthetics, in a floral style made of potpourri and warm autumn colors that reminds one of Grey's Anatomy sugar coating - the never-ending medical drama, with a plethora of sticky references to the latter.A trite and ultra-commercial American production that clearly has benefited from a major marketing campaign. The only genuinely pleasant thing: the landscapes of Maine and New England, with the Indian summer, as well as Boston's skyline and harbor in the background, the scenery, the settings, the bohemian flower vibe, and the nostalgic colors are captivating for the eye, with flashbacks that brings one back to 2001 Autumn in New York.A ""dear diary"" kind of movie that overlooked way too many significant aspects of the main theme, that is to say domestic violence with all that it entails.All the rest, with all due respect, is type 2 diabetes-inducing.Rating: 5, and only out of respect towards those who genuinely go through and have been through domestic violence and for the supposedly fair intent of raising awareness on the topic, though it seems as if the movie has been made out of pure marketing purposes.A truly ""Virgo"" movie with Leo Vibes, just like the lead actress soullessly starring in it.",2.5

manderson-88389,As mentioned in the title I don't what happened in the book but the ending of this movie seems kind of hypocritical. Of course abuse is never acceptable in any case towards a loved one but is it okay to intentionally lie to a potential spouse?.Lily lies about Atlas and the tattoo right off the bat to Ryle. In doing so she basically clowns Atlas when she plays down her first love and sexual encounter with him. Like I said abuse is never acceptable but Lily immediately started the relationship out on lies and secrets. Didn't even bother to tell the guy the truth before marrying him or further elaborate on what the tattoo was about. He has a right to be pissed about that but no right to be abusive of course. I mean Ryle would have been justified to call for a divorce as soon as he read that article and found out Lily been hiding stuff and lying to him the whole time. So for me I feel the message is that Lily is putting an end to the abuse but I think it can work both ways. Put an end to the secrets and the lying to someone and show them who you truly are. I mean they both had violent traumatic events occur in their life and should both be going to therapy. Why only is Ryle going to be the one painted in the bad light? She was not who he thought she was until it was too late. I am sure any human would be pissed to find out this past life and love she had when the marriage was already in place.,1.5
priyankpassey,"Passey Reviews 🎥🍿Here we have the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover's international bestseller, 'It Ends with Us,' starring Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni, and Brandon Sklenar. You'd think it'd be a big cinematic event. The theatre was packed with an enthusiastic young female audience, eagerly anticipating this screen adaptation of a beloved novel. The energy in the room was electric ⚡or at least it was until the film started.If you need a movie to help you drift off to sleep, this one might do the trick. The story moved slower than a 2G connection. And I found myself periodically fighting off the urge to nap in the second half. The characters felt like confused teenagers who never quite grew up, which didn't help the film's already slow pace 😴The lead cast delivered decent performances, but even their collective charisma couldn't save the film from its sluggish pace and lacklustre screenplay 😕While the novel may have been a page-turner, the film adaptation might have worked better as a TV series. With a storyline that drags and fails to fully address the important issues of domestic violence, it would have been better suited for a TV series binge than a one time movie outing 📺So, if you're a fan of the book, brace yourself. The film might not exactly live up to the hype, but hey, at least it's a good excuse to catch up on your sleep 😴",2
sja-awesome,This is an okay movie with some charming yet predictable scenarios and of course they seem to be using female sexuality to try to sell the plot to men. I also would like to say down with the neckbeards. It's actually insane the actors are allowed to go on screen looking like a homeless person with such poor and gross grooming habits or should I say lack of grooming habits. We as women deserve better and men need to be held to standards which they shouldn't be have to told to do. It just blows my mind that actors are hired looking like a homeless person and this is somehow acceptable in our society. So really I'm just review is to say down with neck beards!!,2
cheyeneschulz,"From someone who read the books, the movie was incredibly disappointing. They used 40 year olds when they were originally only in their early 20s. They missed important parts of the book. The way the characters were dressed were ugh. They didnt show the true abuse that Lily endured. Such a disappointment.And I hope the Blake lively isn't cast in It starts with us cus she did not play Lily how she deserved to be played.I hope Blake lively also isn't cast because the way she portrayed the move was a disgust to a movie that shows DV and abuse. Asking girls to wear their florals and bring their girlfriends? This movie is supposed to portray the early signs of abuse, gaslightinf, manipulation and so on. It's not a God damn rom com to froth over.",1.5
rogers-brandon-m,"This was a filthy movie and should have been rated R. Although all body parts were not shown, little was left to the imagination as sex scenes popped off every few minutes. When it wasn't a sex scene, there were abusive scenes. I wanted to leave but my wife was all about it. I was uncomfortable watching it and felt it was extremely ronchy and will be hailed as having ""a good underlying message"" although I think 85% of it was filthy romance. So if you are looking for sex scenes, your movie. If you are looking for something wholesome, avoid it. They could have got the same message across without having added all the bedroom scenes.",0.5
MiiLiex,"Having read the books without expectations that the screen adaption would be a replica, it is putting it mildly to say that that this books adaptation to the screen was a complete slaughter leaving Much to be desired. Several characters somehow transformed from sane everyday people to over the top Hollywood fake-esque variants, as in the case of Ryles sister and her husband. Adult Lily went from an average everyday woman who was building her life to some Hollywood high up entitled brat with personality tendencies that of a passive aggressive teenager. I oddly find myself disliking adult Lily more than Ryle in this screen adaptation, and that is no easy feat! These characters, the story and books deserved so much better than this version without an ounce of relatability. The performances of young Lily, young Atlas and Ryle gave the books dignity but their performances sadly faded in the overall backdrop of disappointment.",1.5

pdenhartog,"Didn't know the books or know what to expect, but gave it a chance because of Blake Lively. Wish I didn't.This movie is so boring, slow and predictable. Every scene you just know what will happen next or what will be the conflict. For the first hour you're waiting for what you know will happen from the first scene, you never feel anything for any of the characters because the story isn't lifelike, realistic or believable. Movie was way too slow and nog worthy of your time or money. Best thing they did was casting the younger version of Lily, who looked a lot like Blake, but other than that it's not great.",2
azsysf,"This film was very impatiently awaited by the Booktok community and it is unfortunately not what was expected. Personally, I did not read the novel, but several people said they were disappointed given the lack of several details about the book on the big screen and the fact that the story was a little ""rushed"" in the film.Now let's move on to my review. The film had incredible potential, it's true that the cinematography was wonderful but unfortunately it was used in a very bad way. Names already like ""Lily Blossom Bloom"" or ""Atlas"" are quite fictitious names, and let me tell you that it shocked me a little that Lily started a flower shop when we absolutely do not know where the money comes from. And her meeting with Ryle on the roof was so fake, these things would never happen in real life and it makes the film difficult to be relatable.Then let's move on to the acting especially of Blake Lively which was unbearable, it seems that Serena Van Der Woodsen was asked to come and make the film herself, the facial expressions (the fact that she bites her lips, and that she moves too much gives the impression that she is blocked in this role) that's why she never had a significant prize in the award ceremony for films, etc. She represented Lily Bloom very badly, and then the fact that the actors are quite old knowing that in the book they are not Supposed to be makes the film very destabilizing.The only part I found was slightly well represented is the part about the DV (Domestic Violence) and again, according to several readers, it was less well represented than in the book and that the book gave them much more emotions during that particular event.Let's not even talk about Blake's behavior after the film, in the premiere in New York when she didn't take pictures with Justin Baldoni and the relationship it has with the fact that Justin is the only actor in the film who really talked about the DV during his interviews. Blake only talks about flowers, romance and life in pink or her new shampoo in her interviews when she should talk at least slightly about the DV but she doesn't do it and it shows that she doesn't care (she and Coolen Hoover but not talking about her now because it's a completely different problem), Several rumors also say that she would not have let Justin do his role as director and that she would have interfered in his job when she is only a producer.In short, this film could have been much better if the acting was much more original, the story much better represented and especially if Blake would not have been so involved in the story to ruin it.",2.5
zuccccccc,"I liked the part where she said ""it ends with us"" and then the credits rolled.I thought that that was a very classy choice on Colleen's part, as the writer and stealth director. When she made a cameo I was overcome with emotion, and reached towards her""Colleen!"" I cried passionately, but she didn't hear me. The camera panned away from her too quickly both times.I thought that it was funny when she kissed her lover on the bus and flipped off those dumb girls behind her, who was saying things like ""eww, I bet they smell,"" and "" isn't there a power imbalance? Is it possible that when you put a roof over the head of a homeless person, and provide them with food and clothing, that they will feel more than slightly indebted to you and will do anything you ask of them?"" and ""gross"". That really showed those girls. Haha, I hate mean girls.I also thought that the relationship with Rile was handled sensibly and maturely.I also want to point out the subtle naming system she has going on. Lily Blossom Bloom, is an emerging florist! Who would've guessed. Nobody. That's like guessing somebody named evilina is evil. You would not do it. Then rile. Aha, he sure does get riled up! Like when he threw their child at the window and said, well, I guess it ends with us huh? That part had me gripping my seat.Then atlas. I don't really know why she named him after the first spinal vertebrae... kind of weird.... But my commitment to Colleen is too strong to focus on this minor detail.Did I mention the dialogue? Stunning. It felt so real, so natural in fact that I felt like I was watching an actual romantic encounter unfold in real time.Ultimately a great movie, or no, I wouldn't even call it a movie. It Ends With Us is a Great film, that left me feeling fulfilled. Would recommend, and would watch again.",2.5
PennyReviews,"'' It Ends With Us '' is a romantic drama based on the popular book of the same title.The movie has nice visuals and costumes and some back and forth in time were well handled.Also, the performances were quite enjoyable, especially Blake Lively, who presented her character nicely. And yes, the ages were changed, but the actors did a good job with their characters, so it wasn't that important.However, the movie feels flat. It is like they wrote down the most important things from the book and were checking them out as they go, without smooth transition from one scene to another. The timeline was also messy. But, at least, they didn't sexy the story up and kept it more of a dark story rather than a romance, as to keep the message clear.",2.5
HJ103NZ,"I didn't expect to be this frustrated with this film. I still feel that the movie is waiting to get started. The beginning of the film continued to build, then it was suddenly over. Why doni fewl the writers were holdong something back? Was this purposefully done? Or am I the problem?Due to the unfortunate media coverage of the behind the scense alledged drama that was plastered all oflver the internet, i never felt fully immersed in the film.I am impressed with the way the heavier parts of the movie were written. The dialogue and the performance by the actors was very well done.I feel like they only scratched the surface with some of the characters, some not fully formed but they surved the purpose of driving the story forward I guess....
Jenny Slate is amazing in her role and she was by far my favourite part of the movie. The writing of her lines and they way she delivered them provided some wonderful moments of light relief that was much needed.Now I need to read the book.",2.5
naraniro_al_amin,"I did not like the movie at all, it was superficial, no conversations, just kissing and sex scenes. I prefer the book. I am in the middle of ""it starts with us"", now I don't even enjoy it anymore, it is ruined for me by the characters that I think they don't fit their role especially Atlas not as written at all. Marchal part was weird spoke twice I guess through out the movie saying he is rich. Atlas the Greek good in the book!. I don't know what else to say. Just the movie is not good and superficial and not reccomended. I agree it has great message but the movie didn't convey it well or not on the right way.",1
